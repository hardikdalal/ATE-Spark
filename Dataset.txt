image[+2]##Good image quality. 
SD500[+2]##We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500. 
design[+2]##It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested. 
image-processing system[+1]##A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition. 
image[+2]##The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality. 
##I've had it for about a month and it is simply the best point-and-shoot your money can buy. 
##I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias. 
##If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there. 
##I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do. 
pricey[-1]##I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey. 
LCD[-1]##I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen. 
##I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me. 
##I received the SD500 on Monday, charged the battery and inserted the SD card that came with it, took a few pictures and waited until Thursday when the 2 GB SD card came that I had ordered. 
##The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting. 
##It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office ñ where no one goes but me. 
LCD[-1]##When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless. 
##I have called Cannon they are sending me an RFA-- I will let you know if they treat me well or otherwise. 
camera[+3]##This camera is truely superb.
pictures[+2]##The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
manual control[-1]##Some more manual control would have been nice. 
##And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness. 
##Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).
##I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs. 
pictures[+3]##They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact. 
##These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
Canon[+2]## I went out and got the Canon today. 
##WOW! Big difference! 
picture[+3]##I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!! 
quality[+2],Sony[-2]##The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion. 
Canon[+3]##I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down. 
pictures[+2]##Sharper pictures. 
##More detail. More natural color. 
size[+3]##The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly. 
powers up[+3]##It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot. 
##I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking. 
##Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly. 
flash[-2]##The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered. 
##This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point. 
##A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad. 
image[+2]##Good image quality. 
##I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor. 
##Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price. 
##You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
pics[+2],user interface[+2],battery charger[+2]##All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
##I have had the SD500 for less than one week. 
LCD[-1]##After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem. 
##Wrong, except that my problems are different. 
##Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one. 
##Stored in a padded case. 
##Never abused. 
LCD[-2]##After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings. 
##LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken. 
##Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries. 
##All had the same results. 
weight[+2]##Camera is a paper weight. 
##Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around. 
##Expected better from a $500 unit.
SD500[+3]##I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
pictures[+2]##The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire. 
Powerup[+2]##Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on. 
640x480 mode[+2],quality[+2]##I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card). 
Camera shake[-2]##you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with. 
Audio[+1]##Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions. 
##I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect
battery[+1]##The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got. 
##If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use. 
##and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.
autofocus[-2]##The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can. 
compact[-1]##I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature. 
manual controls[-1]##Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls. 
##But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
image[+2]##Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality. 
focuses[+2]##My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp. 
##I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot. 
##I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered. 
camera[+2]##This camera is bulletproof. 
##It appears that actual owners of this camera all rate it at a 9 or 10 except for those others who are certainly entitled to their opinions. 
##Personally I love it! It's a definite 10!
start up[+3]##start up is so quick ñ 
pictures[+1]##you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally! 
##totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
lcd[+1]##big lcd screen - at least for me, 2" is enough
picture[+3]##great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great. 
quality[+2]##when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better 
zoom[+1]##digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
zoom[+1]##great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one). 
clips[+3]##i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
merge pictures[+1]##photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
camera[+1]##turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date. 
##shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally. 
##change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too. 
##i just thought it's cute and cool =)
battery[-1]## battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal. 
##(i can't help but play with the camera always)
sound[-1]##the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera. 
##i don't know if i just got used to my A60 or it's just really not that loud. 
##but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
camera[+3],pictures[+2]##i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures. 
features[+3]##if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading 
##as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected. 
camera[+1]##it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
##i forgot to mention about the camera's design. 
designed[+2]##if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer. 
made[+2]##they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
camera[+2]##I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money. 
low-light conditions[-1]##Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash. 
##The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings. 
automatic settings[+2]##If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
camera[+1]##All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price. 
##But believe me, it's well worth it. 
Digic II chip[+3]##Having the Digic II chip helps a lot. 
pictures[+3],size[+3]##This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat. 
starts up[+3]##I still can't believe how fast it starts up. 
camera[+3]##I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice. 
sd500[+3]##I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy. 
edges[+2]##I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit. 
##Buy it, you will love it..... 
camera[+3],LCD[-2]##As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
LCD[-2]##The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice. 
##The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center. 
##I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
##I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care. 
##However, it was not so in my case.
##$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me. 
##Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment. 
##In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage. 
##Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
##My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used. 
LCD[-2]##I took it out one day and the LCD was not working. 
##Who knowsÖ maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken. 
LCD[-2]##Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
##I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera. 
##All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do. 
camera[+2]##I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing. 
##I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it. 
size[+2]##The size of the camera is perfect. 
Fits[+2]##Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket. 
##When I was initially looking for a camera I thought that picture quality was my number one priority, however picture quality aint worth nothin if you leave the camera at home. 
##So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere. 
##I Was wrong. 
camera[+2]##there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things. 
##In good light and low light the things a champ. 
pictures[+2]##I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality. 
flash[+2]##The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent. 
##If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
camera[+1]##I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera. 
##You will not be dissapointed!
camera[+2],movie mode[+3]##This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot. 
instruction[+3]##The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
camera[+2]##I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great. 
photo[+3]##The photo quality is amazing. 
feels[+3],looks[+3]##it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too. 
prints[+3]##I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
image[+2]##As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen. 
colors[+3],video[+3]##another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
camera[+2]##Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go. 
##Highly recommended.
camera[+2]##As it turns out, this is an awesome camera! 
##If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
##The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves. 
##CNET told you not to look for advanced controls. 
preset[+3],user definable[+3]##However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes. 
advanced controls[-1]##I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel. 
software[+1],documentatio[+2]##The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed. 
camera[+1]##Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
pictures[+2]##I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality. 
##Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise. 
##I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500. 
##If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
camera[+1]##Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
looking[+2],fast[+3]##If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you! 
##Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
camera[+3]## am so glad I bought this camera. 
SD500[+3]##All the good reviews for the SD500 are true. 
view finder[+3]##The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer. 
software[+3]##The included software removes any red eye easily. 
pics[+3],small[+3]##if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500. 
##Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
camera[+1]##This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used. 
##Unlike many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas. 
buttons[+3],user interface[+3]##Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect. 
power button[-1]##The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click. 
buttons[-2]##The buttons are rather stiff. 
switch[+3]##I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot. 
build[+1],macros-results[+2],video-quality[+3],flash[+3],white balance[+3]##overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.
camera[+1]##Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight. 
camera[+2],image[+1]##When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive. 
flash[+3]##In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes). 
##The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good). 
##I have see impressive pictures of this camera but also some who are not as detailed as of the Ixus SD500. 
##For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed. 
settings[-1]##Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
focus[+1]##I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
camera[+1]##I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results. 
color[+3]##Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro. 
Picture[+1]##Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings. 
##I use "get ready" and "here it comes". 
manual[+3]##The manual is excellent. 
##Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots. 
##To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display. 
multiple picture[+3]##Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.
powerup[+2],multiple pictures[+3]##Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures. 
size[+3]##Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds. 
##Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web. 
##CNET unfortunately is greatly underrating this camera in its editorial review. 
##Check this one out for yourself for sure!
##I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time. 
##I highly recommend this camera! I can shoot continuous 640x480 60 fps video until my 1gig SD card fills up! 
camera[+1]##I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
##This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever. 
##Finally a Canon with a setting for Snow White Balance. 
camera[+3]##I love the camera.
compact[+2],photo[+3]##This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation. 
##Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem. 
responce[+3]##The camera responce is VERY quick. 
##Almost no lag between button activation and shutter. 
##Camera powers on and ready in about a second. 
pics[+1]##I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face. 
##that u missed in the mirror! 
##Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics. 
video[+3]##And the video quality is amazing. 
##On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!! 
fits[+3]##And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30. 
##An A++!!!
camera[-1]##I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites. 
automatic shutter[-3]##There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens. 
##It seems you have to double click some of the time, but not all of the time. 
##Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry. 
controls[-1]##The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark. 
LCD[-2]##The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
[t]
small[+1]##I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
##Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras.  
camera[+3],size[+2]##I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
memory[-2]##The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
room[-2]##I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
memory[-1][s],battery[-1]##A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
pictures[-2]##Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
camera[+3]##I'd say that this camera is perfect.
[t]
compact[+2]##OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
[t]
size[+2]##I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
small[+3]##It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
##I take it with me everywhere,literally, 
small[+3],durable[+2]##it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
covering[+2]##There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
picture[+3],small[+2]##The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
picture[+3]##The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
##However, I do have a few things to complain about...  
battery[-2]##First off, the battery.
battery[-2]##This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
battery[-2]##Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
##The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
batteries[-1]##This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
zoom[-2]##Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
zooms[-2]##Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
##Very wrong.  
zoom[-2]##The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
start-up[-2]##Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
flash[-2]##The flash is very weak.
##Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
macro[-2]##The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
auto-focus[-2]##The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
work[-2]##To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
focus[+2]##The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
##These are all the flaws I found in the camera, 
cameras[-1][cc]##it's not my first choice in cameras,
size[+2]##I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
camera[+2]##If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.
[t]
##I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100... 
s100[+2]##after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
[t]
##I have had this little gem for four months now. 
camera[+2]##It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
##I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
##I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera. 
##I'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted. 
small[-1]##1) It is perhaps too small. 
buttons[-2],read[-2]##I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
size[-2]##Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
delay[-2],shots[-2]##2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots. 
autofocus[-2]##This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
resolution setting[-1]##3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
##(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
hot[-2]##4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
hot[-2]##It is hot enough to be annoying.
##Canon says it's normal. 
##I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
[t]
small[+3],pictures[+3]##This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
snapshots[+1][cc]##It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
[t]
##I have used many digital cameras. 
camera[+3]##This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
pictures[+2]##Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
wait[+2]##Hate to wait between shots
Download[+2]##Download it fast to your computer
bundled software[+2]##Have a great and easy to use bundled software
size[+2]##Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
[t]
Battery[+1]##FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
color and light[+3]##The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
camera[+3]##I love this camera.
[t]
camera[+1]##I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
smallest[+3],best-built[+3]##It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
[t]
##I bought my camera based on recommendations from my other friends who own it. 
purchase[+2]##I am very pleased with my purchase.
##It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
[t]
camera[+3]##I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
camera[+2][cc]##This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
snapshots[+1][cc]##It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
Exposure[+1]##Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
flash[+2], mode[+2]##Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
zoom range[-1],small[+2]##The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
body[+2]##The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
[t]
body[+2][cs]##It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
##A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
[t]
lcd[-3]##I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
design[-2]##I then realized a major design flaw.
functionality[-2]##All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
screen[-2]##When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
[t]
##I wrote another review and this is the update. 
manual mode[+3]##I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
[t]
##I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures. 
##I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card. 
##Here are some useful facts:- 
##On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures. 
##A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture). 
viewfinder[-2]##The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
##The LCD should be used.
##However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder. 
zoom[-3]##The digital zoom is crap.
##Turn it off. 
fits[+2]##It fits in your pocket.
##The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp). 
##But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
##I take my camera everywhere. 
##Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera. 
##The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff. 
panorama setting[+3]##The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
##You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing ! 
pictures[-1]##The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
flash[+1]##You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
[t]
S100[+2]##The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
movie mode[-1]##The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
mode[+2][cs]##It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
price[-1][cs]##The price is $... more.
[t]
software[-3]##I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
##I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.
drivers[-1]##The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
software[-2]##The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
pictures[+3]##But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
[t]
camera[+3]##I love this camera!
memory[-2][s]## the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
[t]
price[+3]##I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
camera[+3]##I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
[t]
camera[+3]##I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
camera[+3]##I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
[t]
##My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
##The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.
##The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
battery[+2]##But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
[t]
##I've been using this camera for a few months now.
camera[+2]##A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
[t]
##Good quality and fun!
Elph s100[+2]##I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
##I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
##In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
exposure[+2],prints[+2][cc]##The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
[t]
##My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
smaller[+1],resolution[+1]##But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.
[t]
S100[+3][cc]##This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
light[+3][u],tiny[+3][u]##This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
software[+2]##The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
##I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
software[+2]##The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
##I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
on-camera controls[-1]##My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
work[-1][u]##I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
camera[+2]##Other than that, I love this camera.
pictures[+3],color rendering[+3]##The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
[t]
size[+2],metal case[+1],use[+2],picture quality[+1],software[+2]##The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
[t]
size[+3],S100[+1]##If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
image quality[+1],weighs[+2]##The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
[t]
##Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
##One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
##While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.
##I said, can your fancy camera do that?
##No, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.
##End of story.
[t]
camera[+3]##I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
product[+3]##I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
##I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
product[+3]##This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
[t]
##I've been very reluctant to join the digital camera communitysince I've been an avid "legacy" photographer for most of mylife.
jewel[+3][u]##I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
usability[+2],performance[+2],expandability[+2],looks[+3]##I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
[t]
##I've had this camera for three years.
##price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
##I put a 128MB CF card in it.
camera[+2],software[+2]##First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
##I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.
software[+2]##The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
camera[+1],performs[+1],picture[+2],battery[+1]##The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
##If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.
pictures[-1]##All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
sharp[+3],color balance[+3],focus[+2]##They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
pictures of people[-3]##When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
##Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.
##It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
pics[-2][cc]##Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
processing[-1]##I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
##By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
##I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
[t]
##I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
##I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
##I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
##This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
camera[+3]##I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
size[+3]##First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
##The included battery charger is larger!
use[+3]##Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
photos[+2]##I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
use[+2][cc]##The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
optical zoom[+2],cap[+1]##The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
software[+2]##I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
##I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.
##But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
##And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
##One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
##Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
##This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!
##I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.
##As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
##I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
S100[+2]##At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
camera[+2]##It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
[t]
##Why did I wait so long?  detail[-1],color rendition[-1][cc]##If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
##Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions: 
[t]
##got this as it flew off the shelves.
use[+2],images[+2],fits[+1][u]##Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
##What else can I say?     
[t]
compact[+1][u],rugged[+1],use[+1]##I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
memory expansion[+1],macro mode[+1],housing[+1]##I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
##This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
small[+2]##Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
lens[+1]##The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
housing[+1]##The metal housing seems very rugged.
##Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
automatic modes[-1]##I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
auto mode[-1]##For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
auto color balance[-1]##The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
##You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
dynamic range[-1][cc]##The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
macro mode[+1]##The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
LCD[+1]##The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
panorama modes[+2]##The panorama modes are wonderful.
##Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
##High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
small[+3][u],light[+3][u]##It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
auto mode[+1]##In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
manual modes[+1]##The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
##1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
light[+1],compact[+1]##There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
##It's a little jewel.
[t]
Small[+1]##1- Small.
smal[+2]##VERY smal.
##You'll carry it with you every day.
##I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
cameras[+2][cc]##I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
picture quality[+3],use[+2][u]##2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
##Fool proof.
##I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
##3- USB kicks!
##2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
Looks[+1][u]##4- Looks great.
case[+1]##Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
software[+3]##5- Excelent software package.
TFT screen[+1]##6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
##Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
TFT[+1]##Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
panorama mode[+2]##7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
buttons[-1]##8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
buttons[-1]##Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
##9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
[t]
canon s100[+1][cc]##i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
##and i'm glad i did!
[t]
ease of use[+2][u],picture detail[+2][u]##I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
size[+3][u],casing[+2]##This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
ease of use[+3]##Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
##I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
##Definitely a good investment.
[t]
controls[+2],ease of use[+2][u]##The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
##I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
##I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
##Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
zoom[+1]##The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
capacity[+2]##This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
##While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
[t]
##I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
size[+1]##So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality? size[+2]##because, unless it's small, I won't cary it around.
##If I won't cary it around, I won't use it, and if I won't use it, what's the point?
[t]
##My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
##Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
[t]
##I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
size[+1][u],pictures[+2]##After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
[t]
pictures[+2]##I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
size[+3]##The size is tiny, which I love.
##We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
pictures[-1]##Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
[t]
##OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
##Thank you Santa!
[t]
##I bought this camera at the end of August.
##With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.
##I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
[t]
##I've got a couple of digital cameras.
##An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
##Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
##BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.
[t]
##I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
##The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
##I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.
##The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
[t]
##Positives:
[t]
ease of use[+3][u]##This camera is so easy to use!
##I just took it out of the box, charged the battery, and started taking pictures.
features[+3]##All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.
##I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
pictures[+3],size[+3]##The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
[t]
price[+2],features[+2],size[+2],ease of use[+2]##I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
##Well wait no more!
[t]
fun[+3]##I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
size[+3]##You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
##You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.

screen[-1] ## A week out of the box and I began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time , growing more frequent each day .
Display[-1] ## Display glitches and flashes also occurred .
monitor[-1] ## I could tell this was a `` cheap '' monitor as soon as I set it up .
## I sent it back and now will search for a better quality monitor .
## I 'd stay away from this brand , that is , if you ever come across it again .
## 3G Technologies ?
## Searches across the Net come up empty with these guys .
## Two thumbs down .
monitor[-1], colors[-1] ## I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .
## I had a dell latitude netbook that I had to return .

## It is bigger than the dell and the hp mini .
keyboard[+1], color[+1] ## The full sized keyboard is sweet not to mention the aquamarine color .
speed[+1], memory[+1] ## That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .
## I use a netbook for all of my computing with the exception of tax programming and backup .
laptop[+1], form[+1] ## This really is a laptop in a small form .
## I can use several programs at once with little difficulty .
windows 7 premium[+1] ## The windows 7 premium is good -LRB- do n't recommend starter -RRB- and user friendly .
## I can write reports , check social network , pictures , check email , read reviews , and shop at the same time .
slower[-1][a], screen quality[+1], hard drive[+1] ## It is slightly slower than the dell , but it is hard to notice with the very nice screen quality and larger hard drive .

## This has turned into a much better purchase than I expected and it is very light .
machine[+1] ## Overall a sweet machine .
## I 've purchased two of these netbooks , one for myself and the other for my girlfriend .
## Sure , it 's no laptop , but you could have fooled me .
light-weight[+1][a] ## It 's very light-weight , which is why I use this more than my Alienware .
## It does just what I need once fully configured : Add 4GB of ram , clean out pre-loaded junkware , and install CCleaner and MS Security Essentials .
## Those who claim that this netbook falls apart need to stop using it for non-intended uses .
## It 's not a laptop , you need to learn its limitations -LRB- no Photoshop or power apps -RRB- and take care of your gear .
## Buy a neoprene case and keep it protected .
## Most people who have device failures simply push their gear to the limits and then when it fails they turn around and cry foul on the manufacturer .
light-weight[+1][a], device[+1] ## It 's just such a nice , light-weight , non-intrusive device which you can take anywhere .
## I 'm not a fan of tablet computers .
## I think they are interesting , but they do n't serve any practical uses in my opinion , yet .

## 5\/5 stars .
netbook[+1] ## I really love this netbook .
## Huh ?!?!?!?!
## I do n't get all the negative reviews from so many others about this product .
monitor[+1] ## I 've had this monitor for over a year and I absolutely LOVE IT !
## Now I do n't know what kind of video card and connection others are using but I am using an ATI 9800 Pro and have the monitor hooked into the DVI Digital Output instead of the standard VGA which is analog .
picture[+1] ## I do n't think that really matters though - I mean hooked my Xbox 360 up to the standard VGA port a little while ago and the picture was awesome .
## I 'm not discounting anyone else 's opinion of the product by any means because maybe theirs came from a bad batch or something , but just so others can hear a positive review from someone that has been very happy with their purchase for a while now !
speakers[-1], monitor[-1] ## The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...
netbook[+1] ## This netbook is exactly what I want for my kids .
## If I buy something for me , I would consider to buy the same too .

## I highly recommend it , she loves it and we 're both very happy with the purchase .
## If you 're debating getting this item , I would n't hesitate any longer .
computer[+1] ## I 'm not a person well read in technology but this is just an absolutely wonderful computer .
run[-1][v] ## I 've been playing Minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time , and while it does run slower while multi-tasking , the gaming experience is not compromised for me .
keyboard[+1] ## The keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable-although it does take some getting used to .
computer[+1] ## I do n't want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible .
netbook[+1] ## If you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs .
## If you have notebook expectations you will feel `` meh '' towards it because it runs like a low-grade to medium-grade notebook .
## Pros : The capabilities for size and price The keyboard size Windows Premium The look Cons : Be aware that the finish does smudge and gets finger printy , but all polished , it looks incredible Screen size -LRB- but its a netbook , duh ! -RRB-
download[-1][v], run[-1][v] ## Slow to download and run certain programs Wish you the best and hope my review helped !
## Doing business with Amazon is pleasant .
products[+1], price[+1] ## We count on good products at a good price .
Acer Monitor[+1] ## Our purchase of an Acer Monitor was just as we expected .
## No surprises .
## Received this item within a few days of ordering .
hook up[+1][v] ## Easy to hook up .
picture[+1] ## Great picture .
monitor[+1] ## I am very happy with this monitor .
## I had been thinking a lot about changing my CRT montior to LCD monitor .
## I was waiting for lower pricess , faster respons time & wide screen monitor .
## I was keeping my eye on Samsung , Benq & Acer .
## Last week , I visited JAREER Bookstoor in Riyadh -LRB- Saudi Arabia -RRB- I found this LCD .
disign[+1], price[+1] ## It really impressed me with the disign , the specs & the price .
## So , I could not wait anylonger & I got it .
## I will provide my comments about the disadvantages only because the advantages you may get it from the product specs .
direct Elictrical connectivity[-1], connect[-1][v] ## My comments are as follow : 1 - Does n't have direct Elictrical connectivity -LRB- you need Adapter which is comming with the package -RRB- 2 - It is really very difficult to connect the the power Cable & the regular -LRB- VGA -RRB- PC connection .
quality of picture[-1], DVI Connection[+1], VGA Connection[-1] ## 3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .
## 4 - No flixpility to turn the monitor right or left because it is fixed .
## 5 - hight can not be adjusted .
## Some of you may ask how did I gave 4\/5 while having the mentioned disadvantages .
LCD monitor[+1] ## Then I would say that this LCD monitor have many feature in one piece .
## It has TV tuner , Composite inputs , DVI Input , SCART Input , Nice Speekers .
remote control[+1] ## In addition , it comes with a remote control .
screen quality[+1], side view[+1] ## The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .
## In conclusion this master piece has every thing you need .
price[-1] ## One last note , I purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states .
pricess[+1] ## It costs me about 640 $ so you should be gratefull that the pricess in the states much lower .
## Regards , Abdulrahman Saudi Arabia - Riyadh
## Everything on this unit seems fine so far except for one item .
## Almost all new video cards have DVI only connection .
vga connection[-1] ## This means that the vga connection will not work with my computers .
## I will have to find an adapter of some sort which is a pain as a cable should be sent with the unit in my honest opinin .
## I use a dual monitor workstation -LRB- normally both 24 '' -RRB- for web development and video production .
## One of my monitors recently went south -LRB- quit working -RRB- , and I went looking for a replacement .
## Though this monitor is only a 23 '' , the reviews were good and I 've always had good luck with Acer products .
color[+1], brightness[+1], pixel quality[+1] ## I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .
## In fact , my 24 '' Viewsonic has now been moved to second monitor position and this Acer is now the primary .
monitor[+1], resolution[+1] ## Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .
monitor[+1], price[+1] ## Very happy with the monitor and the price ...
monitor[+1] ## I have this monitor for a month now and I 'm very pleased with it .
## I have it at my home office and we sometimes watch movies on it .
widescreen[+1] ## My wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen .
colors[+1] ## The colors are clear , also .
## I purchased this monitor after shopping around for a good deal on a 19 '' LCD .
## What a mistake .
backlight[-1] ## The backlight will periodically fail , the first time it happened I sent it in for warranty repair .
Acer tech support[+1] ## It came back working , and I was momentarily glad that the rumors I 'd heard about Acer tech support did n't turn out to be true in my case .
## The second time it happened I got suspicious .
## I wanted to call acer tech support and talk to someone .
## I managed to find their mysterious phone number from a google cache and called them .
## It turns out they did n't DO anything when they received it .
## They opened it up , turned it on , and it worked so they sent it back .
## Of course , they do n't tell you they did nothing .
Acer[-1] ## Acer has been awful to deal with , they treat their customers like rubbish , and have a miserable repair facility to match their products .
monitor[-1] ## Do n't buy this monitor !
backlight[-1] ## Now when the backlight fails , I have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day .
## Acer will not replace it because the problem does n't occur when they have it .
## worldwide distributor was the worst buying experience in my life , since i started to shop online .
## never ever .
## i 'm regular online shopper , i never had this bad experience in my life , this bring Question .
product[+1] ## I really enjoy this product .
portability[+1], battery life[+1] ## I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .
slow[-1][a], system[-1] ## I felt the system was slow so I purchased a 4gb ram from crucell and replaced the standard 2gb that came with the system .
battery[+1] ## I seem to be getting 5 to 6 hours on the battery which is sufficient for my needs .
## Since I 've only had the computer for a few weeks I 'll report later on my further experience with the system <a�href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KB21KA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-0570718-7655811"> Crucial Technology CT51264BC1067 4 GB 204-pin SODIMM DDR3 PC3-8500 CL = 7 Unbuffered NON-ECC DDR3-1066 1.5 V 512Meg x 64 Memory </a>
## Just walk away .
## I do n't think Acer brand is ready for the USA .
technical support[-1] ## Someday , your going to need support , and Acer 's technical support department is the next to worthless .
## So , my opinion is to shop elsewhere .
## I got this product yesterday ... !!!
netbook[+1], light[+1][a] ## This netbook is very light but still powerful .
Screen brightness[+1] ## Screen brightness is really good .
Sound[+1], size[-1] ## Sound is also nice as compared to its size .
cheap[+1][a], netbook[+1] ## This netbook is closer to the notebook powers but still very cheap .
## Portables are fragile machines that need extra care .
## If you spend a lot of money on a Mac Book Pro spend these extra few hundred too if you prefer a relaxed life .
## I was planning to buy a kindle fire on amazon but just got this little thing packed with 320 GB HD , Win 7 Home Premium , webcam , office starter etc etc. .
## Then I decided to invest few more bucks and went for this netbook .
## I do n't know why people buy expensive gadgets like ipad2 3G ... very satisfied and I think I made very good decision .
delivering[+1] ## Pros : Competitive Cost Win 7 Home premium HDMI port -LRB- I could watch the Amazon instant videos on my HDTV and its delivering great .
## I am so happy that I was clever enough to take out Apple Care as it saved me buying a new computer and a lot of stress .
## Just the other day Apple replaced my computer that was 18 months old due to hassle that occured in the past three months .
Office Starter Web Cam[+1], weight[+1] ## Office Starter Web Cam is also fairly good Light in weight and elegant Cons : I wo n't say anything bad as you are just paying 280 for this net book .
## I would imagine the cost will go upto 200 bucks one day and then it will be unbeatable deal .
monitor[+1], price[+1], cable hook ups[-1][v] ## Nice monitor for price but I agree with other customer review about difficulty of cable hook ups .
## Would like to know what the DVI cable is used for .
monitor[+1] ## I love this monitor .
color display[+1], picture[+1], size[+1] ## Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .
Fits[+1][v] ## Fits perfectly in the corner of my small desk !!
## I bought this monitor as an addition to my existing desktop monitor .
images[+1], text[+1], fonts[+1] ## The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .
price[+1] ## Absolutely love it and cant beat the price !
monitor[+1] ## This monitor works great .
set up[+1][v], pixels[+1], price[+1], LCD monitor[+1] ## Easy to set up , no bad pixels , great price for 19 LCD monitor !
## This is our second Acer LCD monitor .
items[+1] ## Both are absolutely great items .
## Seems as though when Acer started out they seemed a bit on the po-dank side of the computer industry .
## No more !
Acer stuff[+1] ## All the latest Acer stuff is top notch !
Acer Monitor[+1], screen[+1], design[+1] ## The Acer Monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area -LRB- from a heighth perspective -RRB- that many 20 '' screens will not fit in .
brighter[+1][a], weighs[+1] ## Compared to the 19 '' Dell Monitor this replaced it is far brighter and weighs much less .
set up[+1][v] ## Very easy to set up .
monitor[+1], price[+1] ## Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .
clarity[+1], sharpness[+1] ## I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .
## Flying first class at tourist rates .
## Ken Monzingo
## WOW !!!!
sleek[+1][a], monitor[+1] ## This sleek looking monitor is absolutely awesome !!
## Everything appears larger than life !!!
product[+1], unbox[+1][v], install[+1][v] ## This Wonderful product was easy to unbox and install !!
ACER widescreen[+1], ULTRA Slim monitor[+1] ## Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .
## We use these monitors in the office .
## Well , other people do - I use a Dell 20 '' LCD .
video cable[+1], fit into the socket[-1][v] ## First gripe : I set up a lot of these puppies , and the video cable does n't always fit into the socket on the underside of the monitor .
## It 's because of the way the port lines up -LRB- or does n't -RRB- with the plastic of the case .
## To get the cables in , I had to nick bits of the plastic casing on the end of the cable -LRB- and these are the cables that ship in the box with the monitors ! -RRB-
display[+1], price[+1] ## Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .
monitors[-1] ## Second gripe : In the 6 or so months since we purchased our batch of 30-40 of these monitors , 2 have already been returned for repair or replacement .
## That 's at least a 5 % failure rate .
## Not good .
monitors[-1] ## Third gripe : These monitors can suffer from the LCD equivalent of screen burn - `` image persistence '' if you like .
## If you leave an image on the screen long enough , a ghost of that image will persist into the LCD even after you switch the monitor off and on again .
## The image \* will \* go away if you either leave the monitor off for a while or leave a white area of a window under that part of the screen - but it takes time .
## I 'm happy with my Dell .
display[+1] ## I have n't really need any since the display have proven to be very intelligent when resizing different screen res 's and I can use the ATI drivers to adjust things like color temp and gamma .
## I would n't touch one of these Acers !
## For the money you ca n't beat it .
## Dell 's similar monitor is over $ 300 .
## Sure more options but for me it serves my needs totally .
bright[-1][a] ## In fact others say not bright enough ?
bright[-1][a] ## I find it too bright .
## Retired and not a computer geek .
quality[+1] ## For me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable .
## Would definately recommend it .
widescreen monitors[-1] ## Besides , I hate widescreen monitors !!!!
## Also one review said it does n't tilt ?
## It certainly does .
faster[+1][a] ## Much faster than my previous Acer One Netbook with single processor .
Battery[+1] ## Battery last longer too .
## I 'm very happy with the purchase .
## Highly recommended .
## Amazon delivery is very efficient and on time , as always .
price[+1] ## Purchased this item because of reviews and price .
Netbook[+1], Customer service[-1] ## The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .
## Shunted to 4 different `` techs '' with language problems and no knowledge only to be told that a question on a Brand New Printer can only be answered by paying $ 38 per call .
monitor[+1], price[+1], picture[+1] ## excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela
Fits[+1][v] ## Fits nicely on the small desk we use in our computer room .
distort[+1][v], video[+1], pictures[+1] ## It does not distort ; video and pictures look great .
Acer products[+1] ## We like Acer products and this one does n't disappoint .
monitor[+1], Size[+1], looking[+1], 3d[+1] ## Hi , I just got this , and let me tell you is an awsome monitor , Size , looking and 3d is awsome good with this LCD .
## Sadly mine came with 2 Pixels dead , one always is green and the other one is black , I read warranty and says it have to be more than 4 pixels IN THE SAME PLACE to become a valid warranty claim .
## Ok this is not a big issue anyway , 2 dots dont make a huge diferences , they are just annoying .
monitor[-1] ## 2 weeks later , The monitor start having other issues , only half screen turns on , or it become a full green screen and doesnt change , you need to turn it off and on again until it works .
## Im starting the warranty process to see what happens at the end They told me it was normal since this LCD 's are 120Hz you need to let them warm up sometimes is what they told me .
## I hope this dont ends in a square pieces of garbage broken and unable to claim to anyone .
## If this issues still being fixed by turning off and on the monitor , I guess I can deal with it , but I didnt paid the amount of money this babies cost to deal with this ... Shouldnt be that way .
## Im gladly open to any help you can give me .
## After opening the computer for the first time , I notice any javascript links would not work on internet explorer .
## The default settings were turned on .
## I contacted Acer support and they wanted $ 100 to fix the preinstalled internet explorer issues that I was setup with .
## Because it is not a hardware issue , they will not help you unless you pay them .
## After searching the internet for hours and trying countless options I downloaded Firefox to get my internet operational .
Acer[-1] ## I was dissapointed that Acer was n't more helpful .
## I talked to a manager and explained that I had not modified any preset items and they still could not waive the cpu support fee despite the cpu being brand new .
## I would rather hire a local tech support company than pay $ 100 to fix a brand new software issue on a $ 375 computer ... Besides that it seems to be working fine now .
compact[+1][a] ## Nice and compact .
Acer Netbook Aspire One[+1], computer[+1], pretty[+1][a], quality[+1], quiet[+1][a], heated[+1][a], keyboard[+1], laid out[+1], screen functions[+1] ## After much delay I received my Acer Netbook Aspire One and I can teell you I am very satisfied with this computer , is very pretty , well finished , high quality , so quiet , not heated than other netbook or at least I think it is within in normal ranges , the keyboard is very smooth and very well laid out , the screen functions are very practical in a nutshell is an excellent buy and I am very pleased with the purchase , I recommend it .
laptop[+1] ## its definately an outstanding laptop .
expensive[+1][a], design[+1] ## it 's far from expensive for the specifications but there is a lot more than in there ... i like it so much ... its nicely designed for the portable user and I like the Ferrari design on it .
color[+1] ## The color is red and is so attractive !!
weight[-1] ## <p> It 's not lite on weight ... so sad ... I definately recommend it to anyone out there .
## It is wonderful !
images[+1] ## Sharp , crisp images .
## The is the essence of more bang for your buck !
## No issues .
Delivery[+1] ## Delivery was prompt .
Monitor[+1], set up[+1][v] ## Monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired NVIDIA glasses .
increased memory option[+1] ## The operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the Windows 7 Home Professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with Windows 7 Starter doesnt allow , and nobody mention this .
size[+1] ## This is a plus with this netbook , the increased size of 1.6 inches means better and clear view of webpages and woks made in Office .
monitor[+1], speakers[+1] ## This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .
image[+1] ## Sharp image .
small[+1][a] ## Relatively small desktop footprint too .
delivery[+1] ## VERY fast delivery .
price[+1] ## Ca n't beat it for the price .
## I am an extremely experienced computer user .
## In my home I have two servers , five desktop computers , and six different monitors .
## I spend 8-12 hours a day on a computer and often have eyestrain by the end of the night .
## As a result I am always looking for a better monitor .
LED monitor[+1] ## This LED monitor is fantastic !!!
## I bought mine a few months ago and after just a week I noticed that my eyes felt better at night .
Image[+1] ## Image clarity is great -LRB- I do a lot of work in PhotoShop with 18MB RAW image files and noticed the difference immediately -RRB- .
## I also see a difference when surfing the web or using Microsoft Office applications .
## All my future monitors will be LED .
## This unit replaced a broken display on a server with limited space .
worked[+1][v] ## It worked great and we just pluged it in .
## Nothing fancy just reliable replacement .
## This is a great buy !
cheap[+1][a] ## I was a little skeptical because of how cheap it was .
screen[+1] ## However , when I plugged it into my Mac Mini , the screen looked wonderful .
colors[+1] ## The colors and everything are great .
colors[+1] ## I exchanged this from an LG that I bought for nearly twice as much and the colors on the LG were not at all as nice as this .
## There is a slight `` halo '' on the edge of the screen when it is showing blacks -LRB- say for instance the black horizontal bars of a movie -RRB- , but during everyday activities -LRB- email , pages , internet .
## No other screen adjustments with the PC .
## etc. -RRB- you do n't notice it at all .
## Especially when you know you paid less than $ 100 for it !
## I got this monitor to go to a dual monitor config .
## My other monitor is a 23 inch ACER .
display[+1] ## I thot my original monitor had a good image , but the S201HL has a much brighter display .
## Everything is brighter and better defined on it .
weight[+1], battery life[+1], keyboard[+1], screen[+1], heat up[+1][v], HDMI output[+1], local HD decoding[+1], audio volume[-1] ## Pros : Low weight , long battery life , decent keyboard , decent screen , does not heat up , HDMI output , flawless local HD decoding Con : low audio volume , just enough CPU power
switches[-1] ## When it works its fine but I have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches .
## Acer says they will replace it if I ship it back but that costs $ 50.00 .
## I now have a Samsung which is great .
## I bought this to replace an $ 89 2011 holiday special 21.5 '' Acer from Best Buy .
monitor[+1] ## This monitor is much , much better but still not great .
colors[+1], viewing angle[+1], quality[+1] ## The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .
stand[-1] ## My other big complaint about this monitor is the stand .
monitor[-1] ## It 's flimsy plastic and the monitor bounces around while you type .
height adjustability[-1] ## There 's also no height adjustability , so it sits very low to the desk .
## If you use it with a laptop , that might be a plus , but if you use with with an iMac or a taller monitor , you 're going to need some books or something to level them out .
monitor[+1] ## Not a bad monitor for $ 120 but it 's nothing special .
battery life[+1], screen resolution[+1] ## recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly
features[+1], performance[+1] ## Overall , I like the system features and performance .
convenient[+1][a] ## I love that it is a tablet - it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop .
keyboard[-1] ## There is one very annoying problem with this model though : the keyboard is `` sticky '' - meaning , despite this tablet is brand new and just arrived , when I press and release a key on the keyboard it acts as if I kept it pressed , continuing to type the same character again and again .
## Sometimes , when I compose an email and press the `` DEL '' key to delete a character - ooops !
## - it deletes half of the email .
## Unfortunately , this problem happens way too often , a few times per day .
## I did not expect this behavior from a new computer .
monitor[+1] ## I bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago , and I have been very satisfied with it so far .
## Some specifics from my purchase experience were : 1 .
clarity[+1], contrast[+1] ## The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .
## 2 .
shipping[+1] ## The computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast .
shipping[+1] ## I ordered it on a Monday afternoon -LRB- around 2 PM -RRB- and with no extra shipping costs , the monitor was at my door in Chicago by the time I got home from work Tuesday .
## 3 .
stand[-1], monitor[-1] ## The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .
monitor[-1] ## It will only move the monitor side to side -LRB- no up\/down or tilt feature -RRB- .
view angle[+1] ## However , the view angle on this thing is so big that you will see very clearly on any desk\/viewing situation you normally run across .
## 4 .
## Just in general , make sure your graphics card can handle the native screen resolution on this monitor .
## Many computers from 2003 or before may not be able to .
## 5 .
dead pixels[+1], color bleeding[+1] ## I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models
netbook[+1], fast[+1][a] ## the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person , it worked fine , fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it , in fact it works better than my own laptop so I will change to this one as soon as possible
Acer 19-inch flat screen monitor[+1] ## I am very happy with the Acer 19-inch flat screen monitor which I received for Christmas .
screen[+1] ## Things are much more distinct , and I do n't have to strain my eyes and squint when I am trying to read something on the screen -LRB- like I had to do with my clunky old monitor -RRB- .
## AND ... there is now much more room on the top of my desk for me to spread out my work when I am online or pursuing any of my many and varied journalistic endeavors .
## Very happy with purchase .
## Monitor doubles as a primary monitor for a Mac G2 as well as a secondary monitor for a Dell Notebook .
## No problems detected , no flaws noticed .
product[+1] ## Just an average user getting good value in this product .
## I was looking for an upgrade on a monitor .
## I got a new pc so I wanted a nice size monitor for it without busting me in price .
## So I came across the acer read some of the reviews andi was a little skeptical , but the price was right .
picture[+1], colors[+1], weight[+1] ## Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .
price[+1] ## I 'm very satisfied with it especially for he price .
## Did not have a ring around it like other reviews stated .
monitor[+1], price[+1] ## Good monitor for the price .
## Let me start by saying if I could give this review a -50 stars I wish I could .
monitor[-1] ## Maybe some of you do n't have this problem , but I know of over 20 cases of buzzing from this monitor .
## If you do n't know if yours buzzes , try going to a dark website such as Hardforum.com at 120Hz and see if the back of your monitor buzzes .
service[-1], support[-1] ## Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .
monitor[-1] ## I sent my monitor in to Acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random Buzzing from my Acer GD235Hz monitor .
## When I finally got my monitor back from repairs I was given an `` we could not find the problem '' letter .
## I was pissed that they could not find it and even more mad that they did not even bother to tell me before shipping it out .
## Angry that they did not even read the information that I had given on how to duplicate the problem .
chat support[-1], repair technicians[-1] ## You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .
## So I just asked Acer to repair it a second time .
## So when they received the monitor I was very happy that this time that they actually were able to find the problem .
## It took them a total of 5 or so days to repair it and ship it back to me .
## Great .
## But when I finally got the monitor back , it still had the same issue and it also came back scratched on the bezel too .
## Let me tell you that the monitor was in PERFECT cosmetic condition .
## Now I am very angry .
repair team[-1] ## I should 've trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of Acer .
## I told myself it could not be that bad , but it obviously was .
## I would never ever even think about recommending or buying another Acer product in my life again .
## Please treat your customers with respect , Acer .
repair technicians[-1] ## You guys need to hire new repair technicians because the ones that are in the repair center obviously have no idea what they are doing .
## I got this montior for $ 199.00 -LRB- with $ 50.00 rebate -RRB- .
## I am in the computer business and could n't get it at this price from any of my suppliers .
## I expected it to be quite good , the specs were where they should be contrat , response time , etc. .
## I was not disappointed .
## I was impressed .
colors[+1] ## The colors are bright , beautiful and clear .
resolution[+1] ## I am in the business and have seen many 19 '' LCD monitors that sell for much , much more , and aside from monitors with a higher resolution -LRB- ie 1600 x 1200 -RRB- , there is no noticable difference at all .
price[+1] ## This product is hard to beat at any price .
viewing angle[-1] ## I agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast .
monitor[+1], price[+1] ## Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .
## I bought this item at Target for $ 197 , and added to 4G ram the same day .
## When I got home , I uninstalled every useless software , removed others from Start Up list , disabled some services , and other tweaks .
## Then , I installed PotPlayer -LRB- install the 64bit version -RRB- on it .
## PotPlayer is the King of all PC media player .
## It uses GPU hardware acceleration by default .
## Now I can play 1080p movie from NAS drive , downloading with uTorrent , browsing internet all at the same time .
## 1080p movie got no stutter or lag at all .
smooth[+1][a] ## Very smooth .
## Before I installed PotPlayer , I used KMPlayer , PowerDVD , Corel WinDVD and none of them could play 1080P smoothly .
## Audio was always laggish , stuttered , delayed , out of sync ... After I used PotPlayer , it 's like totally a different world ; The difference is like Black and White .
GPU hardware acceleration[+1] ## I think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses GPU hardware acceleration .
laptop[+1], small[+1][a] ## So far , I am super happy with this small yet powerful enough laptop .
## It does everything I want , especially on 1080p HD playback part .
## I am really amazed that it can play 1080p movie flawlessly .
## Again , if you can not play 1080p movie smoothly , I am very sure your media player does n't enable GPU hardware acceleration .
## My suggestion is to download PotPlayer .
image quality[-1] ## If you are not picky about image quality , go for it .
## Otherwise get something more expensive .
contrast[+1], brightness[+1], viewing angles[+1] ## I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .
## These were a ` drop dead deal ' when Target sold them for $ 200 over the Holidays , but they are still a solid value at current prices .
## You will not be disappointed .
## However , if you are still on the fence , Staples has them for under 300 , starting this Sunday -LRB- Feb 19 -RRB- , equipped with 4 gig of ram !
## EDIT : Beep can be fixed , see Violet Swordsmith 's heroic method below .
## Please ignore all the posts about turning off the sounds under sounds .
computer[+1] ## : P Fantastic little computer , does everything I had hoped for work\/study\/travel .
beeps[-1][v] ## However , when you unplug the computer it beeps .
## Not a big deal ?
## HA !
## You CAN NOT turn it off , trust me I 've scoured the internet and even did two hour long chats with Acer -LRB- they pretend they have no idea what is going on then want to charge you money to diagnose the problem .
## lulz -RRB- .
## Anyway , why is this a big deal , it 's just a beep ?
## Well , because it is deafening if you have head phone on , or connected to external speakers b\/c the noise is MAXIMUM volume every time .
computer[+1], customer service[-1] ## Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .
customer service[-1] ## Would n't buy again because of the customer service .
## I ordered this monitor from Amazon on Thursday and I received it on Monday .
shipping service[+1] ## This was very prompt standard shipping service .
## I have limited space with not enough room for a wide screen monitor .
fits[+1][v] ## This 4 X 3 monitor fits my space very well .
monitor[+1], display[+1] ## The monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display .
## I have been using it for about a month and am well pleased with it .
instructions[-1] ## The only negative thing about this was the instructions for adjusting the display were not very clear and it took a little time to figure out how to do it .
## I purchased this as a Christmas gift .
keyboard connector[-1] ## While upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke .
## Not enough time to get a repair before Christmas , so I bought a second one .
## Same result .
machine[-1], Acer[-1] ## I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .
## Update : I sent both machines back to Acer .
## They just informed me that they wanted $ 99\/unit to fix the problem .
Acer product[-1] ## I would not recommend this or any Acer product to anyone except perhaps my ex .
## -LRB- \* _ ~ -RRB-
## I ca n't go back to using anything else at all .
## Make sure you have a nice , smooth mouse , as well a rig that can push out -RRB- 120 FPS on most games .
## Even my SLI 570 's ca n't do that for Crysis , though .
brightness[+1] ## Changing brightness is easy , with four presets and one user changeable -LRB- I leave that at minimum brightness for at night -RRB- .
screen[+1], colors[+1] ## The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .
## You change it to 120 Hz in the advanced screen resolution settings in Windows 7 .
monitor[+1] ## I have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems .
color[+1], price[+1] ## It has good color and price was great .
display[+1] ## Fantastic display ... do n't understand why this model is n't available anymore .
lines[+1], viewing angle[+1], price[+1] ## Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !
## I 'd been looking a long time for a 1280x1024 LCD monitor with with digital DVI input for around 1000 bucks .
## A simple request , but impossible to fill !
AG Neovo 's standout 17 '' monitor[+1] ## It was worth the wait because AG Neovo 's standout 17 '' monitor has all this and more .
## Like a hard glass surface that you can actually Windex , and an attractive minimalist black design that looks like it came from a Swedish furniture showcase .
contrast[+1], crispness[+1], readability[+1], viewing angles[+1] ## The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .
displays[+1] ## When the Matrox G550 Dual-DVI card comes out , I 'll consider purchasing one more of these super displays .
## This is a great gadget that actually works .
## Make sure you check the area coverage before you buy it , though .
## We 've had ours for about 6 months and have no problems with it whatsoever .
Expensive[-1][a] ## Expensive , but for us -- well worth it .
## Now I do n't have to logon to the computer all of the time just to check the weather -- I can just look at my wall .
colors[+1] ## The changing colors help to tell , with a quick glance .
## It 's fairly accurate -- I think ... with a very few minor exceptions .
device[+1] ## The idea of this device is great : it picks up a 5-day weather forecast from AccuWeather and displays the key elements on its screen .
## Icons show projected weather conditions and temperature ranges at a glance , along with the current outdoor temperature .
## Unfortunately , if your experience is like mine , you may find yourself spending a fair amount of time corresponding with Ambient 's apparently sole customer service rep trying to get the device to work properly .
## I have owned one of these for several weeks now and am already on my second unit ; Ambient replaced the first one under warranty after first sending me a refurbished pager board that did n't fit in the unit 's plastic case .
switch[-1] ## The replacement unit had a problem too : the little switch on the bottom was n't working properly , making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area .
## Because I had already had experience -LRB- too much -RRB- opening the case , I think I managed to solve the problem ; at any rate , the unit appears to be receiving updated forecasts for New York City , which has been my primary objective since I bought it .
5-day forecaster[+1] ## So if you 're game for a little fiddling , you may be very pleased with this 5-day forecaster .
## If you ca n't be bothered with things that do n't work properly right out of the box , however , you should probably pass this gadget by .
## I have come to understand why Radio Shack has apparently unloaded their remaining inventory of these at $ 15 a pop ; you may be especially upset by the `` adoption pains '' if you have shelled out the retail price of 100 clams ...
product[-1] ## This product did not work at all .
## It received no signal despite the manufacturers web site indicating full services in my location .
## I was given this screen at work .
colors[-1], brightness[-1] ## I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .
panel[-1] ## For my work this panel is unusable .
viewing angles[-1] ## Others may have better luck , but I have never seen a flat-panel with such horrible viewing angles .
monitors[+1], price[+1] ## These monitors are great for the price .
Shipping[+1], set up[+1][v] ## Shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up .
dead pixels[+1] ## No dead pixels on mine .
Brightness[-1], viewing angle[-1], price[+1] ## Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .
## I would do it again .
## I did quite a lot of research on this monitor prior to ordering .
## Checked the reviews at several sites , all were favorable .
price[+1] ## The price is very good .
instructions[-1] ## I have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it , just a crude pictorial instruction of installation , which leaves a great deal of information missing .
## The included accompanying CD containing detailed information does not want to print out on my computer .
## This info .
## is great but unfortunately I need it on paper .
running[+1][v], picture[+1] ## However , I now have it running nicely and it produces a nice picture .
## It 's worth the money .
## The AOC 2436 Monitor worked very well at first , then seemed to have problems .
## AOC replaced the monitor - almost immediately , but it displayed the same problems .
video card[-1] ## The problems came from my video card .
monitors[+1] ## The monitors were both good .
monitor[+1] ## We are well pleased with the monitor and the company .
machine[+1] ## This machine is a replacement for your desktop .
## It 's that powerful and versatile , and if you 're a windows user , the design of the OS X operating system that it runs will enhance your experience and workflow in ways you ca n't even imagine .
## The aluminum frame beats the old titanium design easily .
heat dissipation[+1] ## Solid , resistant to scratches , better heat dissipation .
## Close the lid , then slam it around , drop it , prop it against the wall and kick it over .
## You 'll break your foot before you break the laptop .
display[+1], text rendering[+1] ## The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .
## A piece of advice : Get the new logitech optical USB mouse with the little app-switcher button on it , and assign that extra button to the Expose feature of OS X 10.3 .
## Use it whenever you 're working at a tabletop or desk .
## Freaking brilliant .
machine[+1] ## This machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be .
## Ordered it immediately after the Macworld keynote .
small[+1][a], value[+1] ## It 's so small , but big value Mac .
## Our `` mini '' is now in the living room attached to a Syntax Olevia LT30HV HDTV and works great !
Superdrive[+1], WiFi\/Bluetooth modules[+1] ## Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .
wireless keyboard[+1], mouse[+1] ## Apple 's wireless keyboard and mouse work flawlessly with the mini .
memory[+1] ## The memory is not really hard to upgrade .
## I have upgraded ours to 1 Gig with third party SDRAM .
## Opening the case with a `` putty knife '' is not as hard as most people think it is .
## The bundled iLife 05 alone elevates this computer from bargain PCs .
value[+1] ## This is an excellent value .
insurance[+1] ## Not that Apple computers break down often but this is cheap insurance for 3 years .
## Do n't buy a laptop or desktop without it .
works[+1][v] ## I have this connected to my late 2008 MacBook Pro , and it works flawlessly .
## Numerous people in the Apple Forums had previously complained saying the Apple Displays had sound issues -LRB- end up being due to not upgrading the firmware to current -RRB- , but I did not have any such issues .
## -LRB- I am running OS\/X Lion and I seem to have the current firmware in the display , and the latest drivers on OS\/X Lion -RRB- Compared to the old 15 '' display , it is like watching IMAX in comparison .
sound[+1] ## The sound is pretty good also -LRB- although not anything like a 5.1 surround system -RRB- There is reflection , but I only really notice it when the display is off , in which case you see you own reflection on the screen .
## I do n't get any anything reflections when the power is on .
## Note there is no power switch - it just detects that your computer is on by monitoring the Apple display-port signals .
## Some people may not like this , but it is very simple .
## I 'd only recommend you buying this if you 're more DIY\/techie and 'd like to take the time and effort to pry your mini open to see its guts and put this in .
## There are numerous detailed installation guides and even a few videos online to get you through the ` cracking the case ' scenario and I definately suggest getting some putty knives over the other strange techniques online .
## As a longtime Mac user - I have always taken the AppleCare extended warranty and have had my money 's worth .
## Once I bought an iSight camera on eBay that arrived not working , and after trying unsuccessfully contacting the seller turned to Apple telephone support .
## They guided me through some tests and from these concluded that I had a faulty iSight , but to my my enormous surprise said it was covered under my extended AppleCare warranty on my iMac -LRB- even after I told them it was a second hand purchase -RRB- , and promptly sent me a brand new replacement !
support[+1] ## Kudos Apple - though your products are of superb quality , your support is equal to that .
product[+1] ## This product is definitely worth the purchase .
## While it is unknown whether I will need it or not , there is one thing I have realized when it comes to Apple .
expensive[-1][a] ## Their products are super expensive , especially to get them fixed .
products[+1] ## However , you DO get what you pay for in reliable products .
## I have been using my MacbookPro for over a year now with no sluggishness or hesitation .
customer service reps[+1] ## I do n't for-see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if I do , I will know that with this product , it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps. The service of Amazon in getting this item to me was faster than I expected and it is exactly what I knew it would be .
## The package was unblemished and the code worked without any problems .
## Two thumbs way up from me .
## Thanks again , Amazon !
## You have never let me down .
## After several months of debating whether or not it was worth the money , I finally bought one of these babies .
price[-1] ## I hesitated for so long because of the price .
## I came close to ordering the 21 '' Samsung several times but really wanted a WS .
## After seeing the in the Apple stores several times , I really wanted one but $ 1300 was a big chunk of change .
## Then when the price dropped to below $ 1000 I gave in .
display[+1] ## Overall , it is an impressive display .
## I am running it with a custom built PC using an ATI 9700 Pro w\/DVI out .
## At first I could not get the thing to work at native resolution at all and any other res would produce strange results .
## Eventually , I discovered that something was wrong with my display drivers and I simply wiped out windows and started over from scratch -LRB- had been meaning to do it anyway and I upgraded the HD at the same time -RRB- .
## After that , it worked like a champ .
## No problems whatsoever .
incompatibility[-1] ## My only grips are the incompatibility with XP and the USB hub in the display .
## This is a well know problem with the PCs and Apple does not seem to care .
## Also , the only hard button controls you get are brightness and contrast .

Works[+3]##Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags.
##Can't complain at all!
[t]
Diaper Champ[+2]##So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.
diapers[+2]##It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
##I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
odors[+2],refills[+2]##I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
[t]
##We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.
##We hated that thing!
##The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
##The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
##And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
##As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.
##We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
Diaper Champ[+3]##The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
bags[+2]##There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
bag[+2]##We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
##There is also no trick to it.
##No spinning it or anyhting!
##Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!
smelling[-1]##Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!
diaper[+2]##We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
product[+3]##It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
[t]
##In concept, it's a fabulous idea.
refills[+3]##I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
##I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.
diaper wipes[-2]##The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
Diaper Champ[-2]##In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.
odor[-2]##My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
##I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.
Diaper Genie[+2][cs]##If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
[t]
Diaper Champ[+3][p][cc]##It's far better than all others on the market.
convenient[+2],refills[+2]##it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
[t]
use[+3]##There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
##Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
[t]
##My daughter is now 2 and 1/2, and I am still enjoying this product.
##We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.
##We liked it because:
garbage bags[+2]##1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
##2. You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you've wasted plastic.
product[+3][p]##3. It never smelled - at all.
##Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
##I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.
##I just know it really worked for us.
container[+2]##The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
##We graduated to real underwear last week in our house, and I'm passing this on instead of retiring it- it's too good to sit unused in the basement or dump.
[t]
##WRONG!
size[-2][u]##Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.
size[-2],odor[-2][u]##It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
##Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage.
[t]
##A MUST HAVE!
product[+3][u]##This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
##The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
##ANY Garbage bags will fit.
Diaper Genie[-2][cs]##The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
work[+3]##This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers.
##FANTASTIC!
[t]
item[-2][u]##I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
[t]
fit[-2]##My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
hole[-2]##The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
##I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
[t]
odors[-2],deal[+1]##This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
[t]
##We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
[t]
##We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
##and what a Godsend!
fill[+2], unload[+2]##It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?
diaper[+3]##It also holds a lot more diapers.
size[+1]##look at the size of it!
##Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.
odor[-1]##I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
##unlike the Diaper Genie!
diaper[+3]##I highly recommend this!
[t]
diaper genie[-2][cs]##For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
##I would not recommend buying that one.
##My second child I didn't get any.
##Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
Diaper Champ[+1][p]##I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.
##I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
replacement[+2]##I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
use[+3]##It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
##I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
[t]
##My husband and I bought this instead of the Diaper Genie since we didn't want to be bothered with buying refills for the Genie.
##Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.
Champ[+3]##The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
##Presto!
##Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.
function[-1][u]##But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.
diaper[-2]##(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.
##A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
##Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
##Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.
[t]
diaper pail[+2]##I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
##I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.
##It was such a pain to use.
##We all hated it.
use[+3]##The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
refills[+3]##And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
##It takes regular trash bags.
##I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
odor[+3][cs]##And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!
diaper champ[+2]##If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
[t]
##It was a PAIN.
##Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.
##it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.
ITEM[+3],use[+2],odor[+3]##THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
##For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
##I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.
[t]
Diaper Champ[+3]##Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
holds[+3]##It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
use[+3]##It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
empty[+3]##It's also easy to empty out.
##Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.
garbage bags[+3]##And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
diaper pail[+3]##Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!
[t]
##My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
##As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
##She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).
pail[+3],odor[+3][u]##Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
Opening[-1]##Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.
refills[+3]##Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
##If you have a really sensitive nose, I can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the Diaper Champ- since the odor is contained in the Champ, once you have to open it to empty out the full bag, you're quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor, and scented bags help with that.
plunger[-1]##As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
emptying[+1]##But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
gift[+3][p]##This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
##I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
##It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.
Champ[+3]##Go for the Champ.
##It lives up to its name.
[t]
product[+3][u]##I love this product!
dispose[+3]##With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
trash bags[+3][u]##Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
refills[+3]##No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!
[t]
product[+3][p]##and we still LOVE it!
##We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
##We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.
##Here's what we love about this pail.
holds[+3]##*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
trash bags[+3]##(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
odor[+3]##*holds the odor in nicely!
use[+3]##(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.
##Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.
Diaper Champ[+3][u]##We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.
[t]
holds[+3]##It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
trash bags[+3]##I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
opening[-1]##The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
works[+2]##It works with a minimum of fuss.
[t]
diaper champ[+3][u]##The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
##I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.
purchases[+3]##This is one of the best purchases we made.
##The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
product[+3],use[+3],effective[+3][u]##Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
champ[+3][cs]##Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
champ[+3],odor[+3][cs]##There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
[t]
pail[+3]##I love this pail!
smell[+3],ease of use[+3],garbage bags[+3][u]##No smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find!
##I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
##4 months later.
##OK.
##I still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that.
##Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
diaper pail[-2]##Solid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesn't really contain the smell.
diaper pail[-2][u]##I still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky.
[t]
diaper pail[+3][p]##I think it's great.
diaper pail[-2]##I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
diaper pail[+2]##It definitely keeps the smell out.
[t]
odor[-2]##But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
odor[+1][u]##First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.
##Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.
odor[-1]##But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.
##Every time!
[t]
diaper champ[+3]##The diaper champ is the best!
##Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart.
##I can honestly speak to its worth!
Champ[+3]##I have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ.
use[+3]##1) The champ is easy to use.
##One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
##You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
##For diaper disposal, you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open.
Champ[+2][u]##With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.
dispose[+2]##It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
##The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
store bags[+3][u]##2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
Champ[+3]##You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
##You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
##Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
##This will never be a problem with the Champ.
##Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
##The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.
Champ[+3]##3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months.
Champ[+2]##The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
##I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
##If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
other pail[-2][cc]##The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.
Champ[+3]##Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.
##The positives outway the negatives.
##There probably isn't a pail out on the market that doesn't get smelly after a while.
Champ[+3]##Let the Champ win you over!
[t]
##My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
##dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
##I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag.
odor[+3]##No need for deodorizers.
empty[+3]##I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
noise[+3]##even did while daughter sleep and no noise!
smell[+3]##I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
space[+3][u]##This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
[t]
##When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.
##We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.
top loader[-2]##We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
Diaper Champ[-2]##We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
diaper wipes[-2]##We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
##This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
##I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
Diaper Champ[+1][cs]##But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie.
[t]
diapers[+3],refills[+3]##It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
smell[+2]##At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
##It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.
##I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.
##The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
[t]
##She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.
Diaper Champ[+3]##Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
operate[+3][u]##It is mindless to operate.
##It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
Diaper Champ[+3][u]##It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
clean[+3]##And it is very easy to clean.
diaper[+3]##I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.
##I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
##I'd abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in.
##I am very pleased with our choice.
[t]
diaper pail[+3]##This is a great diaper pail.
use[+3]##There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
refills[+3]##(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
diaper pail[+3],space[+2]##And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
[t]
##We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
Champ[+3][cc]##and we definitely prefer our Champ!
cost effective[+3],use[+3],capacity[+3][cs]##Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
##Only problem.
unit[-2]##it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.
pluger[-2]##The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
[t]
item[-1]##I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.
diapers[-2]##For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.
product[-2]##The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.  
Diaper Champ[-1]##All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
[t]
diaper champ[+1]##I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
works[+3]##It works great.
smell[+3]##I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
works[+2]##I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
##It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.
##The reviews were definitely right.
[t]
Diaper Champ[+2]##We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
odors[+2]##It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
install[+2],change[+1],clean[+2],use[+3]##It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
##As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
##For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.
##Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
wipes[+1]##We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).
open[+1]##It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
use[+2],odors[+2],bargins[+2]##Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)
[t]
##I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail. 
Diaper Champ[+2][cc]##I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
costly[-2][u][cc]## Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
PRODUCT[+3]##THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
ODOR[+3]##I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!
odor[+2]##No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
Diaper Champ[+2]##In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
##For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:  
##1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
##I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.
##For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! 
##Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.
CLEAN[-1]##2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!
##Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! 
##All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
WORKS[+2]##SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
Diaper Champ[-1]##Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
##In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.
##Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!  
product[+2],price[+2]##All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
[t]
diaper champ[+3],use[+2],refills[+1]##I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
pail[-2]##The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
pail[-2]##I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
[t]
## We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.  
ODEROUS[-3]##That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
##Even when empty!
##So, I took it to the tub, scrub it down with disinfectant.  
semelled[-2]##It still smelled.
##So then I used straight bleach.  
##That seemed to work -- for about 3 days.  
smell[-2]##Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
##However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS - 
bags[+2]##Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
height[+2]##The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
stable[+2]##Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
open[-2]##CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
diapers[-2]##Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
Diapers[-2]##Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first. 
##My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
## (Being a diaper pail, I'd prefer he not be enticed by something so unsanitary.)     
[t]
product[+2]##I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
open[-1]##The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
pull[-1]##The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.
open[-2]##I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
##That would be my only complaint.
[t]
product[+3]##This is a GREAT product!
Diapers[-1][cc]##I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.
##Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?
##I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula. 
##I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"  
works[+2]##The Champ works great.
garbage bags[+1]##We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
odor[+2]##We've never experienced odor from the pail.
assemble[+2], fit[+2]##It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion.
filp[+2]##I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
##Highly recommended!!!
##Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
[t]
unit[+3]##Excellent diaper disposal unit.
##I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).
product[+3]##I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
investment[+2]##A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
[t]
Diaper Champ[+3]##Diaper Champ is great.
##But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.  
Diaper Champ[+3]##So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!
[t]
Diaper Champ[+2][cc]##Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
works[+2]##It works easily with one hand, which is important.
trash bag[+2]##Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.
Diaper Champ[+2]##While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
[t]
seal[-2]##Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
wipes[-2]##Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston.
##Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly. 
diaper Dekor[-1][cc]##I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
##Much more hands off and takes any size diapers.
stinky[-1]##Also much less stinky.
diaper champ[-3]##Don't buy the diaper champ.
##You will be sorry after a few months.     
[t]
##So far so good.
pail[+1],worked[+2]##I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
##I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?  
##Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.
product[+2]##I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
[t]
##Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all. 
pail.[+3]##This one is really great.
Champ[+2]##I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
##I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted. 
Champ[+3]##Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
##We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month. 
refills[+3]##The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!
work[+2]##We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
bags[+3]##We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
change[+2]##We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.
##Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!
[t]
##Don't listen to the bad reviews!
diaper pail[+2]##This is really a nice diaper pail.
diaper pail[+2]##I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
diaper pail[+2]##In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
##Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.  
diaper pail[+1][cc][p]##Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
Diaper Champ[+2]##I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
refills[+2]##1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
work[+2]##We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
refills[+2]##We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
operated[+2]##2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.
safer[+2][cc]##So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
##With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.  
Diaper Champ[+2]##The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
##He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".  
change[+2]##3.  Bags are easy to change.
##Pop the lid, fold it back on its hinge, pull the trash bag through the ring, and take out the dirty diapers.  
##To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.  
##It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.  
##It keeps smells out of your nursery or toddler room!
smell[-1]##Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.
##Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!  
smells[-1][s]##To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.
##Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
Works[+3]##Works great!!!!
price[+2]##5.  The price is right.
##At $30 we put one in the nursery and one in our toddler's room.
[t]
performed[+2]##I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
##Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
adjustment[-1]##The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
##I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
collet[-1]##The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
use[-2]##Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
##I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
[t]
##I did my homework before buying my larger 3+hp router for my router table.
price[+2]##From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.
##I have a mid-size plunge router already, (the DeWalt 621-a fantastic router, read the MANY reviews) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table.
[t]
##I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
power[+1],speed[+1]##But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
##At first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise.
power[+1],runs[+1],cuts[+1]##The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
bigger[-1][u][cc],heavier[-1][u][cc],use[-1]##However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
plunge[+1]##Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
price[+2],power[+1],speed[+1],use[-1]##The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
use[-1][s]##Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
[t]
##I looked at this router and bought a Makita.
looked[+1][u][cc]##The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
##I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
worth[-1][cc][s]##If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
[t]
pretty[-1][u]##It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
smooth[+1][u],powerful[+1][u],affordable[+1][u],track record[+1]##But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.
adjustment[-1][s]##I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
##Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
##Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
costs[+1][u],router[+1]##So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
##Happy woodworking!!
[t]
router[+2]##Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
weight[-1][u][cc],power[-1],precise[-1]##It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation.
##Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
##Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
##I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for.
##And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench, one hand on the spindle lock, and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table.
M12V[+2][u]##In my table the M12V has been a real champ.
##I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
heavy[+1][u],speed[+1]##The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
controls[-1]##With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).
##Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
##Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
##The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
##Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
##This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.
motor[+2],start[+2],speed[+1],price[+1]##Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
weight[-1],power[-1],spindle[-1],chuck[-2]##Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
##Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.

router[+1][u]##This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
solidity[+2][u],nimble[+1],used[+1]##Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.
start[+2]##The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
heavy[-1][u],machine[+1][u],stability[+1]##It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
guide[+3]##The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
##I used this router to plow out 3" raised panels in oak without phasing the beast.
speed[+1]##This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
##The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.
adjustment[+1]##The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
collet[-1]##The only complaint I have is that the 1/4" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4" bits.
##I purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job.
collet[-1]##The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.
##However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
machine[+2][u]##This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
router[+3][u]##Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.
[t]
##I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
##The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.
adjustment[+1],collet[+1]##I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
speed[+2]##The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.
guide[+1]##The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
accessible[+1][u]##The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
heavy[+1],stable[+1][u]##It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.
##Those are the good points.
##There are a few points of contention which I have.
##The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.
plunge[-1]##The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
##This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
instructions[-1]##The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
fit[-1],finish[-1]##Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
##I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
price[+2]##Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.
[t]
money[+3]##This is an excellent router for the money.
##I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
plunge[-1]##The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.
springs[-1]##I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
money[+3]##Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.

router[+2][u]##I must have gotten a good one.
adjustment[+1],control[+1],collet[+1]##I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
##Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.
##I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.
##I have many others in the past.
Hitachi[+3][u][cc]##I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
vibration[+2]##No vibration!
plunging[+2]##Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant.
router[+2],adjustment[+1]##It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
##Why do people spend all that money on accessories to "raise and lower " the router in a table??? A waste of money.
shaft[+2]##It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
balance[+2],lighter[+2][u][cs]##Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models.
start[+1]##The soft start is nice.
price[+3]##The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)
price[+3]##The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
cheap[+3][u]##Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
##I can't complain and Amazons' service was perfect!
##I think I'll go rout something...
[t]
##Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
##I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
##Gave the Dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop.
price[+2][u]##Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
operate[+1]##UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
switch[+1],lock[+1]##Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
heavy[+1][u][cc],router[+1][u][cc]##It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
##I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
##Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
##LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:
spring[-1]##1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
spring[-2][p]##Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
sawdust[-1]##I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
sawdust[-1][p]##Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
##2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.
##Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
##I do woodworking as a serious hobby.
use[+1],result[+1]##For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
price[+2]##Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
[t]
##My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.
##The owner had three routers - all M12's.
##This was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router.
##In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
M12[+3][u][cc]##After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
router[+1][u],plunge[+2]##On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
use[+2] ##I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
slop[-1]##The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
##Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.
big[-1][u]##If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..
[t]
##This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.
##She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
router[+2][u]##What an upgrade!!!
starts[+2],runs[+2]##I have only used it with the 1/4" collet and a 1/2" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly.
adjustment[+2][cc]##The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
use[+2], vibration[+1]##The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
price[+3]##Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
router[+2][u]##I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
##Now I need to get some 1/2" bits...
[t]
router[+2]##I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
stable[+2][u],use[+2],visibility[+2]##I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut.
fence[+1]##It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
controls[+1]##Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
simple[+1][u]##I prefer things that are simple.
##I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
##I now  have it as a permenant fixture  in my router table.
power[+2],control[+1]##The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
guide[-1]##I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
##It will take 31/2 inchers now.
springs[-1]##I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
adjustments[-1]##I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
wrench[-1]##I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.
system[+2]##Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.
##I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
[t]
router[+1]##I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it.
quiet[+1][u],power[+2]##It is quiet and has plenty of power.
stability[+1][u],weight[+1]##I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
plunging[-1]##That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
shafts[-1]##Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
shafts[-1][p]##After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
plunge[-1]##I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
plunging[-1],router[+2][s]##If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.
plunging[-2]##If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.
[t]
performance[+2],features[+2]##I love the performance and features of this router.
money[+3]##For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
quiet[+2][u],adjustment[+2],speed[+2]##It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
##I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
##I've done some hand-held routing with it and it works good for that as well.
plunging[+1]##Smooth plunging mechanism.
fence[+1]##The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
##The only thing I hate (and this pretty much goes for any router I've used) is changing the bits.
grip[-1],chuck[-1],collet[-1]##It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.
router[+2],performer[+2]##Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
[t]
router[+1][u]##I purchased two of these beauties.
##For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
router[+2]##I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
router[+3]##One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
##My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
collets[+3]##The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
##I have since used them to cut all the stiles and rails for my first kitchen.
collets[+1][p],power[+2]##They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
money[+2]##I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
setup[+2]##The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
##I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
##As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.
router[+2]##I would however highly recommend the m12v router !
[t]
Hitachi M12V[+2][u]##I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
##This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
##I mounted mine in a home brew table and used a router lift.
operation[+1],speed[+1]##The smooth operation variable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results.
router[+1][u]##Its well made and user friendly.
router[+2][u]##You'll love it!
[t]
##This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.
router[+3][u]##It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
##I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
start[+1],runs[+1]##This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.
router[+1]##I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
power[+1]##It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.
price[+3]##For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.
router[+2][u]##You just can't go wrong with this one!
router[+1][u]##Enjoy.
[t]
price[+3]##This is an excellent router for the price.
##This is my second one.
router[+3][u]##The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
[t]
tool[+1][u],powerful[+1][u]##This is a well-made and powerful tool.
[t]
##At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.
price[-1][cc]##I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.
##I bought it!
##I have 5 routers, I use them all!
##I make furniture and cabinetry.
##I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.
##Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.
M12V[+2][u]##The M12V has been great.
adjustment[+1]##The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
bog[+1]##The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
##The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail.
quite[+1][u],workload[+1],cheap[+3][u]##What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
##Good luck and cut wood!!!!
[t]
router[-3]##This router was a huge disapointment.
adjustment[-1]##The depth adjustment was sloppy.
control[-1]##The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.
control[-1][u]##It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
control[-1][u]##My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
heft[+1]##I did like the heft of the machine.
stable[+1][u],heavy[-1][u]##It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
router[-2][u],control[-1]##I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
router[-1][u]##All in all, not very good.
[t]
price[-1],router[+3][u]##I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.
##I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.
##Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
##The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
power[+3]##The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
adjust[+1]##The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
adjustment[-1]##The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
price[+2],router[+2][u]##I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
[t]
##I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
##If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
router[+2]##The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
machine[+2][u]##I recently had to run a 3/4" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down.
router[+2][u]##I could take 1/2" passes and it still didn't skip a beat.
##As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
Hitachi[+1][u]##I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
price[+3][u]##Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
router[+3]##I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
router[+3][u]##It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
[t]
##I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
starts[+2],speeds[+2],depth[+2],power[+2]##The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
router[+3][u]##I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
router[+3]##If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
router[+3][u]##I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
[t]
power[+2]##I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
bog[+1]##It doesn't bog down under load.
Cuts[+1]##Cuts are easy and smooth.
works[+1]##I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
adjustment[-1]##The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
adjustment[-2][p][cc]##I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.
wrench[-1]##Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
latch[-1]##The sliding latch is does not stay in place.
##It is almost all you can do to change bits with two hands (you need three).
##I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
router[+2]##Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.
price[+2]##I really liked the price...
[t]
##I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
##It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.
##Because of this I have removed the handles.
control[+1]##I like the speed control.
##It works well with the larger bits.
##(I prefer 1/2 inch bits).
power[+2]##It has plenty of power.
adustment knob[-1]##The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.
Router Razier[-1]##Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
##After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
##The one wrench systems makes changing bits somewhat difficult.
wrench[-1]##I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.
router[+1]##All in all I am pleased with the router.
power[+1],noise[+1],control[+1]##The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
[t]
##I have owned this router for nearly five years.
##Until recently it was my only router.
##Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
heavy[-1][u]##It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.
control[-1]##Recenly the variable speed control went out.
control[-1][p]##It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
##The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service.
##I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
##I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.
plunge[-1]##The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
router[+2][u]##Overall it is a great value.
price[+3]##For the price I don't think you can beat it.
[t]
tool[+3][u]##This is a fantastic tool to use.
heavy[-1][u]##Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
product[+1]##This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
[t]
##I have purchased & used 2 of these routers in the past 3 years.
last[-1][u]##They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start.
safety[-2]##My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.
##First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.
##Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.
##I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
router[+2],money[+2]##When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.
##But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.
##Then, without warning, it took off again.
safety[-1][u]##Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
##I use these routers under a table.
##Outside of needing an extension for half inch bits, which is a problem for most machines of this type.
depth[-1]##Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
depths[-1]##You must keep double checking depths.
machine[+1][u],money[+1]##But, for the money it is a good machine.
duration[-1][u]##Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.
control[-1]##The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
##I am now waiting for this one to stop.
router[+1][u][s]##For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
equipment[+1][u][s]##For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
safety[-1][u][s]##If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
##Don't get this...keep browsing. 
##The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far. 
##I'm still figuring out why.
features[-2]## There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
##My friend has this unit while not experience it much, I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy, and it's definitely the most overrated gadget in history. 
sound[+2]##SOUND QUALITY: The iPod's sound quality is pretty good.
## The Creative player sounds a bit better, but not anything to worry about.
equalizer[-1]## It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod. 
bass[+3],treble[+2]##The bass is deep and the treble is clear.
battery[-2]##  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
##This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore. 
##iRiver's battery lasts four to five years. 
Replaceable battery[-3]##Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE.
## However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support. 
##The iPod's battery, 1.5 years. 
##Yeah, pretty weak.
flip side[-2]## Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
## While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.
case[-2]## Also, not liking the gel case. 
##iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.
features[-3]## FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature. 
FM tuner[-3]##There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners. 
voice recording[-3]## There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
photo viewing[-1]## There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
## There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
use[+3]##  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
##The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad). 
iTunes[-1]##I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software. 
##I just don't like it, the weird thing is, I don't know why I dislike it.
## Maybe because it doesn't have a lot of skins to choose from like WMP, but then again, I dislike WMP as well because it's slow on my computer. 
##Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
## BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer. 
CUSTOMER SERVICE[-3]## CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier. 
##If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty. 
##They have the nerve to charge you $30 for a warrantied iPod.
technical service[-3]## There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
##At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.  
iPod[-3], sound quality[+2], design[+2]##OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average. 
##Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead. 
##God Save Apple	 I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac. 
##Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple. 
Ipod[+2]##The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company. 
Apple[+2]##Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!     
ipod[+2]##I have an ipod and it is a great buy. 
##It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
sturdy[+2]## Very sturdy and strong.
games[-1]## Doesn't have alot of good games on it.
## the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs. 
##buy it.      
iPod[+3],service[-2]##iPod is brilliant, but service was awful
## Wow iPod. 
##How did we listen to music before it?
##This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc. 
iTunes[+2]##The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod. 
##iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download. 
click wheel[+2]##This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.  
##It allows fast and easy navigation.
## The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read. 
song quality[+3],ear buds[+3]## The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
scratches[-1]## The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches. 
##It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.
Battery life[+1]## Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge. 
##I use my iPod all the time. 
## You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc. 
##The problem with my iPod. 
## The first one I received skipped songs randomly. 
## I had to send it in for repair, and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me.
## I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved.  
##However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now. 
Apple[+2]##Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products. 
product[+2]## The product I rate five stars, 
service[-2]##but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
## However, you should still buy an iPod!
## The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
Amazon[+2]##  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.  
##I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it. 
##iPod will change the way you enjoy music!      
##Very Pleased.
##I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
interface[-1]## The interface took a little getting used to.
## The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it. 
display[+2]## This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual. 
photos[+2]##I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous. 
sound[+1]## The sound is just fine. 
##I'm not a big audiophile, but I have no objections to how it sounds.
## I use it to listen to language tapes and to play "Earl" by the Dixie Chicks incessantly.  
adapter[+1]##It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.  
##I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end. 
##Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss. 
photo quality[-1]## One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
## I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.     
##Here's the TRUTH in short....	 
##This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons. 
Hard Drive[+2], affordable[+2]## Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable. 
Screen[+2]##Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2" 
Battery[+1]##Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.  
##12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
FireWire[+3],USB[+3]## FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
Design[+3]## Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus. 
sound[+2],Durable[+2],compact[+1]##Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy 
Games[+1]##Games-- not really important, but existant 
Hold[+1]##Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket. 
Radio Tuner[-2]## Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
Voice Recorder[-2]##3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have.
Memory Stick slots[-2],Battery[-2]## No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
iTunes[+1]##. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod. 
accessories[-1]##No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
Overall[+1]##  Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.
##  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player. 
## This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.     
##Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead	 If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look. 
##I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
## A sound decision and a happy customer right here!
## I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400. 
##The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!   
##It's a plug n play device, recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer. 
##No need to install the iTunes. 
Versatile[+2]##Versatile and stylish.	 
design[+2],capacity[+2],connection options[+2],iTunes[+2]##I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.   
battery[-1]##The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').   
controls[+2]##The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed  
##And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive. 
iPod[+2]## The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.      
##Still not so sure about this one...	
iPod[-1]## First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself. 
## So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
##  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.  
battery[-2]##In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
##  Again, another hassle. 
## To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.  
##But enought of the negativity. 
quality[+2]## I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
## Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones, stereo, etc).  
interface[+2], use[+3]##Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.  
##Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so. 
## I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine. 
iTunes[+1]## As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough. 
## I haven't used it to purchase any files, so I don't know about that.
##  All in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.
iPod[+2]## In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
##  In the end, I haven't used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money. 
##Do your research before you buy it, and especially talk to other owners.      
## i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city. 
##when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out! 
##simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
## the packing inside was in tatters. 
##i didnt touch the product. 
## i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.
## they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost. 
##then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
## a week passed but it was never picked up.
## the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company. 
##buyers BEWARE!     
##There's got to be a better solution...	  
##I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
sensitive[-2]## *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily. 
## You must buy some sort of protective case unless you want your ipod to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it.  
##*	The 20 GB version doesn't actually have 20 GB, but 18.5 GB, which makes a difference of roughly 300 songs. *	
Battery[-1]##The Battery does not last 12 hours.  
##Like I said, I've had my ipod for six short months and I'd estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most.
##  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it. 
battery[-2]## You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
volume[-1]##  *	You can't turn the volume up very high, but I think this might be for health reasons. *	
freezes[-1]##My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
apple[-2]##If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.
support service[-2]## The user support service isn't too great either.  
##Buyer beware!      
iPod[+2]##Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
design[+2],capacity[+2],iTunes[+2]## Its sleek design, large memory capacity, compatibility with iTunes, and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market. 
capacity[+2]## Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.  
##At an average of 14 cuts per CD, that's over 350 CD's. 
##This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
##You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.
wheel[+2], backlighting[+2],iTunes[+2]## Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer. 
equalizer[+2]##There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
accessories[+1]##  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster. 
reformatted[-2]## The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so. 
##Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod. 
## The box comes with iPod, ear buds, iTunes and iPod software, USB 2.0 and FireWire cables, and a home charger. 
## You  will need a computer with a six-pin FireWire or USB 2.0 port (USB 1.1 
##For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
## PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card. 
ITunes[+2]##ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.    
##Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).  
##Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
steel backing[-2]## Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.  
device[+2][p]##All in all, this is a wonderful device.  
##About 1/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.
weight[-1],solid feel[+2]##  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel. 
## Highly recommended for people who like to listen to music or audio books on the go.          
scratch[-2]##Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!	
## Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
## So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...   
##great product with Limited Services
## I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
##  It was worth it, as I use it to this very day.
scratches[-2]##  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
Apple[+2]##  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.  
##However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations. 
## It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island. 
## However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.  
##After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out. 
## This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads. 
## So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.  
Apple[-2]##Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services. 
## This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.  
##Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
##  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market. 
## And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it. 
Battery[+2]## Battery non-issue. 
## The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
## If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.
##  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
##  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life). 
## Finally, if your battery gives out, you can use any number of reputable iPod services to swap it out for <$50 and you're good to go for another 2.5 years (or longer if battery technology improves.)  
##Ask yourself how often you've seen battery covers break on consumer electronics. 
##They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so. 
##Given that, I find the iPod solution reasonable: keep the case sealed and let the battery be changed by a technician once every 2-3 years. 
##No big deal.  
##You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
## In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.  
iPod[+2],use[+2]##Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use. 
iPod[+2]##The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.
purchase[+2]##This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
## I am a total iPod addict. 
sound[+3],bass[+3]##The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
## I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
## I love my new iPod!     
Versatile[+2]##The Great And Versatile iPod	 I love my iPod! 
##I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.
## I wish I had a long time ago.
sound[+3],controls[+2]## The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out. 
iTunes[-1]##As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance. 
##The first install did not work correctly and would never transfer music to the iPod (but did allow me to register with Apple and load songs into iTunes). 
##Eventually I had to uninstall the whole works and reinstall it from scratch, and from then on it has worked like a dream.
iPod[+3]## I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.
##  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity. 
##Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
## That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB. 
##The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane. 
battery[+1]##The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use. 
outside finish[-2]##  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up. 
quality of audio[+2],controls[+2],capacity[+2]##(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!     
## Still my favorite MP3 player	 Is it overpriced ?
## Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
iTunes[+2]##  Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just plug the USB cable in, wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod.
##  At first I primarily used it as a stand-alone portable player but it wasn't until I decided to take it in my car and use it to play back music that I truly adored this device.
## Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal. 
## I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
amplifier[+2]## And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
proprietary[-1]##  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
## I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.  
##Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one.
## I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
##By far the best MP3 player I've ever used	
## This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
## If you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it. 
##However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise). 
##I still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and it's still working flawlessly.
iPod[+2]##  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority. 
iPod[+3], interface[+3], design[+3]##For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
## It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
##  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus. 
##You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
## However, with the iPod you cannot. 
##The music MUST be on your computer.
## If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
##Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files. 
##They were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?). 
play WMA[-2]## Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT. 
##Considering the fact that just about any CD you purchase and "rip" to your hard drive will be formatted as a WMA file, iTunes version 4.5 (included with new iPod releases) contains an auto-converter that converts WMA to MP3 for iPod compatability.
## My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages. 
##I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.  
##So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.
## The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).  
##Also, I don't like how when I first set up my iPod, it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation, it will not configure the iPod, and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod, and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod "hard drive" to a new letter.
## If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software! 
## This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use. 
##In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!  
##Confused yet? Don't be.
## This is really the only downside to the iPod - setting it up and downloading music. 
USING[+2]##The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
##  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
design[+2]## The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days). 
battery[+2]## The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
## The list is endless.
## The entire database is set up flawlessly and really works well.
## I love scrolling through the menus - that may sound strange but that's how FUN using the iPod actually is!
sound quality[+3]## The!  sound quality is great. 
earphones[+1]##The included earphones are pretty good - my advice? 
##Don't apply the black cushioned protectors. 
##First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
## Just kidding.
## But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off. 
##But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
## I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.
use[+2]##  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.
## As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
hard drive[+1]## With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive. 
##This is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the iPod to even carry around some of their word documents.
## I'm sure future generations of the iPod will be able to carry much more, probably even videos.  
games[+1]##Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs. 
##The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others. 
##  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music. 
##When I first saw "music trivia quiz" I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - it's not.
## It's a lot of fun and really tests your reflexes. 
##It's a good way to pass the time.
storage space[+2]##  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
##  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.
## Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
## If you want to add more, just delete some that you haven't been listening to recently.
## I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod! 
##It's just my personal advice but you're saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod, it's very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything.
iPod[+2], capacity[+2], price[+2]##  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
## At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
## My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter
##.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market. 
##Whether you're on the go or just want to lounge around the house listening to music, you could definitely do much, much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable product from Apple.
##Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW	
## Let me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.  
##However, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.  
##When I finally got it, I was amazed by how asthetically pleasing everything was, including the packaging. 
## The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
##  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch. 
## For this reason, it is very easy to drop.  
##One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
##  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.  
Itunes[+2][u],Design[+2][u]##Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
## To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel. 
## Organizing music is a breeze too.  
## You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!
Finding[+2][u]##Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.
sounds[+3]##  It all sounds great too. 
headphones[-3]## As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears. 
## I recommend Shures (shure.com). 
## I have the e3c's, and man does everything on the ipod sound great.   
store[+2]## You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.
##  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this. 
## The outlook is a little clunky to use on the ipod, but it is functional. 
##   I LOVE THIS IPOD!  So why, you ask, did I give it only one star?  
BATTERY[-3]##Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY. 
## To see a great little short film about this, go to ipodsdirtysecret.com  ##Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.
batteries[-3]##  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
##    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.  
pay[-3]##However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS. 
## Hence, the one star rating...     
##Good, But Not For Everyone
## I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
## I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
##  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off: 
interface[-2]## LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.  
## I'm not one of them.
##  While I like the minimialism of the player, I try to avoid plastic products made of white- they tend to yellow with age. 
##While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.  
scratches[-2]##The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
##  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.  
##THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread. 
## I disagree. 
## I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it. 
## I thought the clickwheel sounded great, but after trying it found it awkward.  
##As a student, I spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am used to scrolling up and down on the touchpad, which made the Creative Zen Touch a more attractive product for me. 
## Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat. 
BATTERY[-3]## BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around.
## The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
## Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.  
##IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up. 
## Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
##  But since a lot of these MP3 players are marketed on aesthetics, do go to your local store or borrow a friend's and see how the product actually feels and works.
##  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.     
##	Pure And Simple, Wonderful Stuff.
iPod[+2]##	 If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one. 
##If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras. 
##This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.
##  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver. 
##Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short. 
##The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver. 
##Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has. 
reliability[+2]##So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
##  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.
## The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod. 
##But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.
## It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.  
looks[+2]##For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod. 
package[+2]## The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player. 
## Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish. 
##I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
##Just don't drop it.
## I had the 15G iPod of the previous incarnation. 
## Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once). 
## Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.  
##Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.
##  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
##  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.
##  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s. 
## Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products). 
## I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably. 
## When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
##I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying. 
## Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
design[-2]## Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.  
##I don't really intend to drop mine to find out. 
## The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
## Not that anybody would revert back to their old-skool walkman just because you can knock it around more.  
##The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.  
##But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
scratch[-2]## We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
## The other thing is the earbuds.  
earbuds[-2][p]##First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
##  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them. 
## With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two. 
## And I'm really not that rough with things! 
iPod[+2]## These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one.
##  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
##  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.
alternative[-1]##  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.  
iTunes[+1]##Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything. 
##  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini	 
##A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
## I'm writing about the 4G IPOD 20GB model.
## I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.  
##I'm glad I did.
##  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.
player[+2][p]## The player is great. 
## I didn't think I would need more than the 5GB that the mini has, but... once I downloaded a few audio books on top of my CD's -- I'm GLAD I have the extra memory.
battery [-1]## However, the battery life isn't as good as I would like. 
##There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips. 
## For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
##  Think about that if you are worried about battery life. 
product[+2]## Overall, this product is AWESOME. 
features[+2]## All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.  
##I love it.
##I like it.	
## Pros Holds a ton of music. 
##No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place 
use[+2]## Really easy to use.
click wheel[+2]## Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
helpline[+2]## Has a great helpline.
USB[+2],charger[+1]## They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
I-Tunes[+1]## They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
Breaks[-2]##  Cons Breaks easily. 
Hard drive[-1]##Hard drive screws up occasionally
## Warranty expires only after a year.
## Is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks.  
I-Pod[+2]##The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used. 
##I have a ton of cds and I make a mess trying to organize them into things.
## The I-Pod certainly helps me with my music and I can take it anywhere with me.
## I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer. 
##Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people. 
##I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!     
##So far it has worked out great	 I
## held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'. 
use[+2]##I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives. 
##It was worth the wait.
##   The 'click wheel' is much easier to use, compared to the previous generation's models with the touch screen. 
##It takes seconds to work the menus and go from song to song.  
USB[+1],firewire[+1]## This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now. 
##Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
use[+2]##  I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes. 
##Both are EXTREMELY user friendly and take minutes to get used to.
##   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time. 
##Two DVDs to capture all 2,400 tracks. 
##Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.   
##The first battery charge lasted only about six hours. 
##That may be due to the fact that I used the menus a lot, and had it hooked up to the Griffin iTrip (The iTrip works great) for most of that time.
## The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
## I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.   
sound quality[+2]##I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
## I bought the JBL Creature speakers for home use, and they work great with the iPod. 
##Match them pretty well to boot.  
## The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen.
## It is sharper on the 'mini' units. 
screen[-1]##This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see. 
##The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery. 
##You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.  
## The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.
## Talk about convenience.
## I would strongly recommend you get one !!     
##I Love My iPod!
## Although iPods have been around for a few years, they didn't really get hot until now. 
##I ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas. 
features[+2]##I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it. 
##It DESERVES a perfect 5-stars.
battery[-2]## The only problem is the battery life.
## After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should. 
##After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one. 
battery[-2]##Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100! 
##Amazing.
## You pay $300 for the iPod itself, then $100 to get the battery fixed. 
##If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price. 
##Apple needs to step it up and get better, longer lasting batteries.     
##Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...	 I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio. 
## It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
## I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands. 
## I am so in love with this thing I can hardly stand it.   
## It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.  
##It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover. 
## The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable.  
arm band[+2]##The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.  
design[+2]##I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.  
sound[+3]##The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing. 
## It sounds 10 times better if you use the little black foam cushions that slip over the buds.
click wheel[+2]##  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.  
##A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.
##  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
##  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.  
##I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off! 
iTunes[+2]## I am a big fan of iTunes, simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site.  
##However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
##  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
##  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
##  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.   
## The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles). 
## I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads. 
## It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning. 
## All in all, the good far outweighs the bad. 
## This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
##  I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac. 
Apple[+2]## Way to go Apple!  
##You've earned a new fan.     
##Product Of The Decade	
## What was the biggest must-have item of 2004?
## Yep, the iPod. 
##Sales of Apple's mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide, and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years. 
##That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
## But is it worth all the hype? 
##Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it? 
##Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products? 
##There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
## However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.  
iPod[+2]##I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, "I WANT THAT ONE!" I was willing to shell out 
[t]
router[+2]##This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it. 
setup[+2], installation[+2] ##It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up. 
install[+3]##By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do. 
works[+3] ##It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is. 
##That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual. 
router[+2][p] ##It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house. 
router[+2] ##There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it. 
##I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
##apart on their reviews, they are talking about installation problems and what not. 
setup[+2], ROUTER[+1][s] ##Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!     
[t]
install[-2], router[+1] ##It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.  
##If you have good networking knowledge, you'll abandon the wizard, use the 100-page online manual, and be fine.   
##I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.  
Wizard[-2][u] ##The Wizard is particularly sinister. 
wizard[-2]##It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC. 
##After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8. 
##These are just some of the pathetic examples.  
##They!
##provide no printed manual. 
##I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website. 
##Stupid me. 
##It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD. 
##But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard? 
##No, of course not. 
##You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.  
setup[-2] ##The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial. 
##It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.  
##I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.  
[t]
##If you're buying this product and operate on a Mac platform, ditch the CD and go directly to live assistance on the Linksys website.     
router[+2] ##I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself. 
##I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison. 
##(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)
configuration[-2][cc] ##HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup. 
##I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support. 
##But wh!
##en I opened the box I found little more than a few advertisement flyers and instructions to run the enclosed CD before plugging in the router.  
CD[-1] ##Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac. 
##(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
##) After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips. 
user manual[-2] ##I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless. 
technical support[-2] ##The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac. 
##It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something. 
##But eventually I found my way to live assistance through their site (thank GOODNESS), where someone was able to give me adequate instructions to configure the router so that I could at least use it. 
instruction[-2] ##I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
##meone would just give me some instructions in plain English.  
##The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant. 
documentation[-2] ##What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS!
##! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance. 
##I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
setup[-2] ##* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable. 
product[+3][p] ##But the product iself is great.  
##If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product. 
router[+3][p] ##Once you set it up, it's great. 
well-priced[+2] ##And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting. 
##Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.      
[t]
##For an item that is not even available in Best Buy and the other major stores when I went to buy it, the fact that ... has these in and out of stock, and that I received it in only a couple of days is knowledge enough to make this a winning situation.  
##What about hookup and use? 
performance[+3][u] ##Another 5 star performance. 
##Having never hooked up a wireless network before, I took the advice of the quick start guide that came with the unit, and used their included CD. 
##They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right. 
##Having seen the problems that some others were having with setup, only to be resolved (some of them) by exactly following the directions, I decided to do it that way right out of the box. 
##I'm glad I did. 
CD[+3] ##This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time. 
##Shutting off what they t!
##ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install. 
##Not even one glitch. 
##The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.  
##I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install. 
##Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house. 
##No Wires !  
speed[+3] ##Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room. 
##When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps. 
##Let's get a perspective here. 
##A standard modem works at 56K tops. 
works[+3] ##This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte. 
##Their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte. 
##So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem. 
running[+3] ##I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
##nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed. 
##I know I am getting specific, but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment, based on how close the base unit is to the PC card. 
##What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.  
Broadband[+3] ##Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies. 
##As soon as you click on a site, it appears on the screen.  
##Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast. 
##The operating system is Windows XP. 
Installation[+3] ##Installation was as near automatic as can be. 
##They do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP. 
equipment[+3]##All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment. 
##Follow the directions exactly. 
##It is easy. 
##Hope this helps.     
[t]
WEP encryption[-1] ##I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA. 
##Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever. 
connectivity[+2] ##Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.  
firmware update[+2] ##New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration. 
configuration[+2] ##All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network. 
router[+3][u] ##Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.  
installation[+2] ##Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router. 
setting up[+3] ##You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.  
costlier[-1][u] ##Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco. 
##But I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending. 
##Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !
[t]
##It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.  
##I had an old wired Linksys router.  
##The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it. 
##There was a big sticker inside the box saying "RUN CD FIRST - DO NOT DISCONNECT YOUR CURRENT ROUTER".  
##And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.  
##So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.  
instructions[-2][u] ##There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.  
##If I did not know anything about networking whatsoever, I might be stumped at this point.  
##But since I do have a little experience, I simply disconnected my old router and put in the new one.  
##I do know what wires go !
##to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc. 
##So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.  
security[-2] ##The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.  
##There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.  
##If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.  
##But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.  
works[+2] ##The router works fine for both wired and wireless.  
connect[+3][u] ##I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.  
connect[+2][u] ##Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.  
##But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.  
##I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !
CD[-2][u] ##little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.  
router[+2][p] ##I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.     
[t]
##Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product. 
enterprise piece[-3][u] ##This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment. 
##You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line. 
##People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves. 
##They need to step up and buy an enterprise level piece of hardware for a lot more money. 
##That aside, this is not that bad of a product. 
router[+2][p] ##I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it. 
##With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem. 
##If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers. 
##P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!
##all kinds.  
##On the subject of Third Party firmware; Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux. 
##Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware. 
##So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux). 
##The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be. ##However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5. 
hardware version[-3][u] ##The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half. 
##Simply put, the hardware is just too small to run Linux, which is a really bummer since I found it fun to play with my Linksys WRT54G's firmware.  
##However, if you are not a tech person and!
WRT54G[+2][u] ##just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it. 
##Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself. 
##Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption. 
##All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.  
##If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router. 
##They have the large amounts of RAM and still run Linux. 
WRT54G[+3][u] ##I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.

##I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.  
##The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the "Speedbooster" version.  
##After asking around, I found out I didn't.  
##The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.  
CD[-2] ##I tried the CD setup program without any luck.  
##Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.  
##Nope.  
##That didn't work either.    
##A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.  
##No hold time.  
1-800[+2][u] ##Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem. 
CD[-3] ##Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.  
##I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
##ite:  www.linksys.com/connect  I clicked on NetSet Assistant and let it do it's thing.  
##I followed the prompts to disconnect and reconnect Ethernet cables, and then rebooted.  
##Problem solved.  
##As far as WEP configuration... make your adjustments after you've set up the router using the default setup.  
product[+2][p] ##It'll make life a lot easier, and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review.  
router[+2] ##This is my fourth Linksys product and, aside from the rough start, I'm very satisfied with this router.     
[t]
##I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs. 
router[+3][p] ##This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE. 
##For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed. 
range[+3] ##The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
[t]
##I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP.  
##A great service which I highly recommend. 
##I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.  
##I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.  
##I wrongly thought that it was the router.  
##Fool that I was! 
##After countless attempts at recycling the modem and WPA keys etc.
##,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.  
WRT54G[+3] ##I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!! 
##Be sure to call your ISP with the modem's MAC address to get online.  
##YOU WON'T get connected otherwise. 
##My ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes.  
##Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
##Check it out.     
[t]
##I got this for my aunt who pretty much knows nothing about computers. 
set up[+2][u] ##It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems. 
##Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing. 
instructions[+2] ##there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth. 
installation[+3] ##And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow. 
product[+3][u] ##A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years. 
##I'd also recommend wireless products made by Belkin. 
##i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.     
[t]
security[+2], speed[+2] ##I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed. 
router[-2][p] ##However, this product performed well below my expectation.  
stream[-2], copy large files[-2][u] ##The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.  
##I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.  
##Although it will work for a few minutes, it will eventually hang. 
##This behavior (hanging) also occurs when I transfer large files between my PCs.  
design[-2] ##After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).  
##If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.  
security[+2] ##As I mentioned in my first paragraph, it supports WPA security, which is far superior to WEP.  
setup[+3] ##In addition it is very easy to setup.  
##I w!
use[+2], security[+2]  ##anted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.  
##However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.  
##The reader can find a better product with the competition and at a lower cost.     
[t]
##I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem, instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC, as and when needed. 
works[+3] ##So far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections.  
##My next project will be to try out sveasoft firmware to increase this unit capabilities and wireless range.     
[t]
##I used to own a $20 after rebate cheapo wireless router that I thought would be adequate enough for a home wireless networking. 
##Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.  
##The cheap router I used to own had very minimal feature in the configurations menu and less security options then the Linksys WRT54G. 
##But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time. 
##I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.   router[+2] ##I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for. 
##You won't regret it. 
setup[+3] ##The setup was very easy. 
instructions[+2] ##Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time. 
design[+2], anteanna[+1] ##The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.   
##No more connection!
signals[+3][u] ##drops and strong signals even from the backyard. 
security[+3], configuration menu[+3]##The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.  
Linksys[+2][u] ##Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys. 
quality[+2] ##The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.      
[t]
working[+2] ##I got it working fast enough.  
router[+2][p] ##It is a nice router in all ways but one.  
reliable[-2] ##It is not reliable.  
access[-2][u] ##A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet. 
access[-2][u] ##That is, you cannot access the internet at all.  
##All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.  
##Just no internet.  
##You have to unplug the unit to get it to work again.  
router[-2][u] ##Very annoying.    
##I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway. 
##My mistake.  
##I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.     
[t]
##I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.  
##See my other reviews for the details.  
Broadcom hardware[+2] ##I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.  
##This is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.  
##I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.
[t]
##I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work. 
CD[-3] ##The installation software CD crashed repeatedly. 
##Thinking the CD was faulty, I went to the Linksys website, hoping to simply download the setup program, but it's not available. 
connection[-3] ##I then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.   
##I'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so. 
##Very disappointing.     
[t]
wizard[-2] ##I couldn't get the install wizard to work.  
instructions[+2] ##However, setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze.  
install[+2] ##It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.  
##If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).  
##If buying for home office or small business this is a must.  
##For effort free wireless network adaptors, use the linksys USB adaptor.  
##If you need convincing on the security side, read Wireless Hacks, (this is a book of excellent tips, not just security), published by O'Reilly.  
wizard[-2]##Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it.     
[t]
##My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service. 
Linksys[+1][cc] ##While I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time, my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys.  
install[+2] ##The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process. 
##I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6. 
##I also had to do this with the old router.  
##I used Linksys technical support several times. 
support[+3] ##Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable. 
##Granted, I am a professional technologist with years of experience.  
priced[+2] ##Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!
products[+2][u],support[+2] ##at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.     
[t]
##Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.  
works[+2], range[+3] ##It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.  
Compatibility[+3] ##Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
##Then this is the way to go. 
[t]
Setup[+3] ##Setup in XP was instant and intuitive. 
##However, your PC cards should also be Linksys "g" rated, as interoperability has been a problem on some "b" cards. 
pipeline[+2][u] ##The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients. 
##Therefore, if you have a really robust connection (like a T3), this will help. 
##If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL, it's probably not going to be noticeable. 
quality[+3], tech support[+3] ##Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.     
[t]
##This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards. 
installation[+2] ##My experience with installation was quite good.  
installation[+2] ##I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).  
wizard[+1][u] ##The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).  
setup[-1], documentation[+1] ##The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.  
##The whole process was probably about 10 minutes.  
##Setting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and!
##running the installation wizard again.  
set up[+1] ##I haven't tried to set up any advanced features on the router, but it is not difficult to set up for basic use.  
documentation[+2][cs] ##The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.  
router[+1][cs], signal strength[+2] ##I like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners, seldom falling below the "very good" range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router.  
transmission speed[+2] ##The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.  
backward[+2] ##I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the "mixed mode" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.     
[t]
##I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem. 
router[+2] ##As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market. 
##If you want "the newest gadget" get the one with speedbooster. 
use[+2][u], features[-2] ##I like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit, and some wanted features, like a list of computers accessing my wireless, is not easily found on my router.   
router[+1][p] ##All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one. 
##Expect about 10MBps and not more though!     
[t]
##I upgraded my network to wireless with this router.  
router[+2][u] ##I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.  
set up[+3] ##All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.     
[t]
product[+3] ##This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year. 
##In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year. 
range[+3], connection[+2][u] ##My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now. 
ROUTER[+3][s], works[+3] ##IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....     
[t]
product[+3], firmware update[+2] ##I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G, and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally, the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product!
[t]
satellite[-2][u] ##It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.  
tech support[-3], user guide[-1] ##There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.  
##The only way I got the thing working (this was with a DirecWay satellite):
[t]
quality[+3] ##I just upgraded to the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G router last month and I am very happy with the quality of the product.  
multipurpose[+3][u] ##This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.  
[t]
##Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card. 
connection[-1][u] ##I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection. 
[t]
##I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card. 
setup[+2] ##The inital setup of the router was simple. 
##The PC card setup was painless as well. 
Works[+2] ##Works pretty well. 
##Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews. 
DHCP[+2][u] ##The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server. 
##Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.
[t]
##This concept seems to be unusual. 
##Cisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device. 
##They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5. 
##They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time. 
##Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.  
##There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices. 
##Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done. 
##If it was a software comaptiblity issue or a component availability issue, explain it to us so we don't have to theorize on the motives.  
##In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
##uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections). 
##Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?     
[t]
product[+2], desktop card[-2][u] ##This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.  
desktops[-2] ##I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.     
[t]
##Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
##My new Toshiba M35-S359's Wi-Fi capabilities became apparent when I took it on th eroad over Thanksgiving. 
Linksys[+2] ##My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic. 
[t]
##First, I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart.  
##Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR. 
##You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.  
##Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought. 
documentation[-1] ##Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.  
##What is really needed with these are plug-ins, (ever present software controls) standard from the operating system, (OS) (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.
##) that use some type of connect standard where the OS does all the work.  
##It's not here yet!  
##Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.  
##The reason is simple, one word, and "security".  
##The average Windows based computer, can exist on an unprote!
##cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it. 
##They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.  
##In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.  
##It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.  
##Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.  
##You'll have to reinstall everything you put on, from the day you first turned it on.  
##Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.  
##What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?  
##For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.  
##A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.  
##Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
##from the cable modem you are using.  
##Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.  
##In addition, your port address is now the router, not your computer.  
##Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.  
##Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware. 
##This is what is commonly called a firewall. 
##You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.  
##Here is where many typical problems begin.  
##Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.  
##You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.  
##These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !
##online games, or downloading files from sites with different security levels.  
##With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, "the wireless connection".  
##Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.  
##Computer novices should have a computer savvy person install, and set-up their router.  
##You are really the ones that need this the most.  
##Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.  
##Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.  
##Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?  
Linksys[+3] ##Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.  
##Linksys is made by Cisco, the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet, and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size.  
reliability[+2] ##ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.  
##You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.  
model[+2][p] ##This model appears to be especially good.  
##Why the four-port wireless model you ask? 
##You may only have one computer.  
##True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.  
##Still, if you think there may be more computers in the future, and there is a need for a multi-port network.  
##If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
##Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.  ##What about the wireless capability, you ask.  
##Well, if your network has or will have, computers in other rooms, you may not want to wire your house for Ethernet. 
##This is especially true if you don't need the!
##speed of a wired connection.  
##Don't worry though, the primary computer located by the Linksys, can be connected by wire, this makes for a solid, and fast connection to the Net.  
##My last topic concerns the security setup you do, or have done with your router.  
##Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router. 
##As said before, you may get some conflicts.  
##The other issue is how secure do you want it.  
##You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.  
##Even things like the downloaded files, and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive.  
##Another thing you may do are the many file transfers needed to playing network games.  Some settings allow you to play, but not host a game, others won't even let ##you connect to play.  
##It may take several attempts, and reading a lot of FAQs or network help sites to fix some of these issues. 
##However many you open up, remember you are putting holes in your firewall, making your computer!
##less secure.  
##You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.  
##Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers. 
##They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.  
##It is a good place for new users, who want to feel safe, and they do provide a good measure of safety, but they are not the total answer.  
##Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.  ##Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security. 
##The purchase of a router is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself these days.

set up[-1][u] ##I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek. 
##I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else.  
##When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly. 
works[+2], cheap[+3] ##The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too. 
##Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC. 
##I bought one for my niece and will be installing it like a pro (shhhh, don't tell her I had help).  
work[+2], security[+2] ##If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.

##I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago. 
##It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home. 
##To be honest I got it just to link up my Xbox (attached to a WET11 wireless ethernet bridge)to my cable modem (ISP Comcast), so I could get rid of the 70 feet of ethernet cable that ran down the hall. 
##Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it . 
setup[+3] ##The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge. 
set up[+3] ##To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins. 
##Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace. 
##Nor did I need any settings from my ISP. 
setup software[+3] ##The setup software did everything. 
##This is my first foray in!
##to the wrld of wireless and it couldn't have gone better. 
connection[+3] ##My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable. 
##My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G. 
router[+2] ##In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router. 
##There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem. 
##Great items !     
[t]
speed[+3], signal quality[+2] ##A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality. 
look[+1] ##I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler. 
speeds[+2] ##I am getting better speeds on all my web programs. 
router[+2][u][cc] ##There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router. 
setting[-2] ##I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy. 
firmware[-2] ##The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys. 
##VERY IMP. 
##After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.  
##Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up. 
instant setup[-2] ##The instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually. 
router[-1][cc] ##This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
##4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this. 
VOIP[+2] ##It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys. 
##At first I was going to give it a really bad review. 
connection[-1] ##The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.  
##The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware. 
##But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program. 
Speed[+2][u],signal[+2],Configuration Options[+2]##Pros.1.Speed  2. Signal Strength  3.Advanced Configuration Options
Customer service[-1]## So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.  
Configuration[-2],Software[-2],UPnP[-2]## ##Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
[t]
##I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled. 
disconnecting[-2][u] ##Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best. 
##When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router. 
##Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.  
junk[-3][p][s] ##Stay away from this junk. 
##Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.     
[t]
router[+2] ##Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.  
WPA encryption[+1] ##In fact, it supports the new WPA encryption standard, which is WAY better than WEP.  
Works[+3][u] ##Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA. 
Feature[+2][cc] ##Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.     
[t]
##I'm going to be moving soon. 
##One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection. 
##Got the Linksys after reading some reviews. 
software[-3] ##Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac. 
##But everything worked out for the best.  
##After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo. 
working[+3] ##Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm. 
Tivo[-1]##The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g. 
backward compatible[+3] ##However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.  
connectivity[+2] ##Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.     
[t]
logging[-1] ##(...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging. 
##And provides near zero-statistics. 
##SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing. 
##This is universal across every brand I've worked with. 
##If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it. 
##Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.  
##I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations). 
##Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.  
##BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID. 
##SSID are like filenames in Windows. 
##When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID. 
##If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!
##ID on their router.  
##MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic. 
##MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router. 
##You don't have to monkey with the PC config. 
##Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.  
##Best practice is learn how to setup encryption. 
##WEP encryption is weak but most computer people couldn't figure out how to break it. 
##WPA is best. 
##Problem is sometimes you can't get a visiting laptop to work with certain encryption. 
##Getting Apple/Macs was historically a pain, but they've all improved interoperability now. 
##Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.

##I've had this Linksys router.  
reliable[+2] ##For more than a year, and it is totally reliable.  
signal[+3] ##No down time, great signal strength.  
##Worth every penny plus for those who are really into networking.  
features[+3] ##There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.  
Setup[+3], web site[+2] ##Setup is totally breeze and Linksys's web site is pretty easy to navigate.  
cheapest[-1][u] ##Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.  
##But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.  
firmware[+2] ##The fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion. 
##I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay.  
##Nothing came to mind.  
router[+2] ##So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html      
[t]
working[+2][u] ##Absolutely no problems with this router. 
instructions[+2] ##I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions. 
customer support[+2] ##A call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance.  
##I have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks.  
Speed[+2] ##Speed is not a problem.      
##I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG! 
##I can't notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour! 
works[+2][u] ##After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine. 
##If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it! 
Linksys[+2] ##As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.     
[t]
setup[+2] ##Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
[t]
##First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house. ##For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever. 
##However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me). 
##As I'd just purchased a new computer with a Wireless G adapter, I figured I'd upgrade the router as well and set it up as it's supposed to be.  
##I first purchased the Wireless G with Speedbooster. 
##Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions. 
##Quite frankly though, I've never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware. 
##The documentation was just horrible. 
##When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first". 
##So I run the CD, and get all kinds of quirky error messages. 
##Somehow the adap
##ter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured. 
##I call tech support, which was clearly overseas, and I'm pretty sure he understood me about as well as I understood him. 
##After 15 minutes on hold and 10 painful minutes with this guy, he basically tells me to download a file from their website which will walk me through. 
##I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better. 
##But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?  
##Anyway, after learning that the "Speedboost" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5). 
##Best decision I've made in a long time. 
##First, the router was on sale for $49 at Circuit City. 
CD[+3] ##Second, the setup CD actually worked perfectly. 
##I was able to use t!
##he brower-based administrative screen with no problems. 
installation[+1][cs] ##I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router. 
performance[+3], documentation[-2], support[-2][u] ##The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4. 
manual[-2][u] ##Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc. 
##If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.     
[t]
##I tried and failed using the D-Link 624 108M wireless router. 
##Coverage in my 2-floor brick-walled house was poor and erratic. 
##I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box. 
##Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing. 
antenna[+1] ##When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage. 
##Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.   setup[-1] ##Setting up the system was not too complicated. 
##Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones. 
##Then, the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul!
##d be in the same IP range and see each other. 
##Basically, I set up the box to work as "router" (!
##) as opposed to "gateway", disabled DHCP and gave the router an IP number within the range served by the DHCP service from the modem.   
##Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.  
##All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.  
signal[+2][u] ##Having done all this, I was quite pleased to see that all corners I needed were decently covered by the signal. 
speed[+2] ##The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard. 
##For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for. 
##If it is needed to make a multi-100 MB disk tranfer (such as back-up copies) it makes sense to connect through the wired network.  
signal[+2][u] ##Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc. 
##In my oppinion,!
coverage[+2][u] ##the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.     
[t]
router[-3][p] ##We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.  
connection[-2][u], slow[-2][u] ##It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.  
##It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes. 
support[-3]##The tech support is worthless too.
[t]
##The world of MP3 players is blinding, and since most people don't understand the technology [myself included], user-friendliness is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. 
instruction[-2] ##Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset. 
touch-pad[-2], navigate[-3] ##After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files. 
##When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities. 
EXPLAIN[-3] ##SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
navigating[-3] ##Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
##I don't care what ELSE it can do.
##I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
sound[+2] ##All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD. 
bass[+2],highs[+2] ##The base was deeper and the highs were crisper. 
touch-pad[-3], instruction[-3] ##Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it. 
[t]
##Why get locked in to crappy Itunes weather you want to or not? 
machine[+3] ##what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
##i got 6000 mp3's you'll never register or gay up.     
[t]
##Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars. 
##I just discovered another con in my list of pros and cons.
Zen Micro[-2] ##This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another.
##Ahhh! There is a catch, the manufacturer does not tell you. 
store[+2], INSTALL[-2] ##Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!! 
##I just tried to move a load of plain data files from my home computer to my office work computer, and it is promting me to install Zen Micro software, etc.... 
##I have used similar devices and they are seamless and simple. 
software[-2] ##Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?  
##This brings my review to one star! 
##But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.  
sound[+3], portability[+2] ##The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it. 
##It COULD have been a great product. 
##Why isn't it? 
##Read the next six mixed pros and cons: .  
##1.
Button sensitivity[-2] ##) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive. 
##The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. . 
##2.
FEATURE[-3], recharge cord[-3] ##) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord? 
cost[-3]##You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost. 
##If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer. 
##The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer. 
charged[-2] ##I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged. 
##Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket. 
##If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market. 
product[-2] ##I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. 
##What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord? 
##Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc. 
##Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. . 
##3.
prices[-3] ##) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices. 
case[-2] ##The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case. 
case[-2] ##If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. . 
##4.
battery[+3] ##) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. 
##Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries. 
rechargeable battery[+3] ##Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. .
##5.
##) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired. 
FM receiver[+1] ##The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great. 
FM receiver[-1][cc] ##IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed. 
##I have gone through two of them in two years. . 
##6.
constructed[+3][u] ##) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. . 
charges[-2] ##As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.     
[t]
Zen Micro[+2] ##Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
##  Why?  
size[+2], space[+2][u], battery[+2], look[+2]##Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  
touchpad[-1] ##The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
small[+3] ##I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.  
Media Source[+2], file transfers[+3] ##Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.  
Sound[+2], fm tuner[+2], recorder[+2] ##Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  
player[+2] ##This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.        
[t]
##I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users. ##I first want to say that I think Apple is making the same old mistake as they did with Macintosh years ago. 
##This proprietory software to download. 
##(That was a major turn off). 
##I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod. 
player[+2][p] ##Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you. 
##The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style. 
Headphones[-2] ##and supply those stupid white Headphones. 
##I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well. 
##Let's face it. 
##Apple is Apple. 
##So Creative should be "Creative". 
[t]
##I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now. 
##With so many choices it was a tough decision. 
##My first instinct was to go with an iPod. 
##I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.  
##I started looking at the Creative Zen Micro and after reading numerous reviews from message boards and magazines I decided I'd give the Zen a try. 
##All I can say is what a wonderful choice! 
##I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!  
small[+3][u] ##Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player. 
##I popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up. 
installation[+3] ##The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch. 
##I did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in. 
##Pressed play and I was off. 
touch pad[-1] ##The touch pad does take a little getting used to. 
##I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.  
cable[+1],adapter[+1],headphones[+1], stand[+1],pouch[+1]##The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.  
Zen Touch[+3][u] ##Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch. 
looks[+3] ##It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges. 
player[+2] ##For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.     
[t]
player[+3][p] ##I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it. 
##I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
Speakers[+2] ##1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.  
Look[+3], Feel[+3] ##The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience. 
##The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing. 
tiny[-1][u], back[+3] ##The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ). 
feels[+2][p] ##It feels tiny in the hand without it. 
stand[+2] ##The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk. 
##The belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot. 
looks[+3], read[+2][u] ##The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read. 
touch controls[-1] ##The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel. 
touch buttons[+3] ##The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.   
Build[+3] ##Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing. 
hardcase[+1] ##The hardcase they give with it must work well.  
solid[+2][p] ##It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.  
sound[+3] ##Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too. 
sound[+3] ##I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  
sound[+3] ##Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.  
features[+3] ##Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list. 
##Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book. 
recorded[+3] ##The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal. 
##The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.  
software[-1] ##Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well. 
playlists[+3] ##Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.  
battery life[-2] ##There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons. 
USB[-2] ##Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.     
[t]
creative zen[+2] ##I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.  
##i have a lot of files in wma so that was the biggest factor in my decision to purchase the zen.  
headphone jack[-3] ##HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.  
##by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.  
support[+3] ##The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.  
##i havent used it much yet so i dont know if i will have the same problem; obviously i hope not.  
organization[-2][u] ##i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.  
##in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.  
##and if you have 2500 songs, as you might very well, you will be reluctant to edit the clip properties of 2500 files.  
sound[+1] ##the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.  
headphones[-2] ##the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.  
installation[+2], touch pad[+1] ##i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.  
##you just get used to it after a while.  
cheaper[+2][u],WMA files[+2][u] ##i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.  
price[+2][p] ##all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.

##This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis. 
##If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod. 
##Bottom line.  
##However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod. 
##For whatever reason. There is also a low number of people, like me, who love iTunes but want to get the Zen Micro. 
##I'll talk more about that later.  
##First of all, why does every single piece of media library software that comes with an MP3 player suck? 
##(iTunes being an exception of course). 
software[-2], feature[-2][u] ##The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder. 
##I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain. 
##Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.  
Player[-1] ##NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.  
##1.
##Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW. 
##Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD. 
sensitivy[-1] ##Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.  
##2. 
##Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site. 
player[-2]##This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.    
##POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1. 
battery[+2] ##The battery is removable. 
##You can buy a new battery for 49.99. 
##With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
## 2. ##
FM radio[+1] ## FM radio built in (Howard Stern).  
##3. 
microphone[+1] ##Record memos using the built in microphone.  
##4.
looks[+2] ##The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it. 
##The photos don't do it justice. 
back[+2] ##The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.  
##5. 
storage[+2] ##You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.    
##Now, about the iTunes. 
iTunes[+1] ##I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).   
##This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list. 
##After that, you connect your Zen Micro and open My Computer. 
##Click on "Zen Micro Media Explorer" and then click on "Transfer Data Between PC and Device" after that, a File Explorer window opens. 
##And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.  
##It's not as seamless as if you were to use an iPod, but it only takes a few seconds longer. 
##So yeah, you can have the best of both worlds.  
##* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work. 
##You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.  
##**I honestly don't see the point of buying songs from iTunes when there are so many free alternatives. 
##But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.     
[t]
##I'm addicted to music. 
##I'm also somewhat of an audiophile. 
##Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me. 
##On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine. 
##On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality. 
##I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro. 
##I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut. 
##The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb. 
##The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go". 
##So that's the one I bought. 
##Too bad.  
made[-3][u] ##First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made. 
player[-3]##One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.  
sound[-3] ## Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad. 
eq[-3], bass[-3] ##The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding. 
volume [-1] ##Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality. 
headphone jack[-3] ##The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having. 
##They didn't really make any difference. 
##I also experimented with an adapter for the car. 
sound[-2] ##If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to. 
car adapter[+2] ##However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter. 
##Hands down, better quality than ipod's. 
##that isn't saying much, but hey, I like to be positive.   
storage[-2][u] ##Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs. 
storage[-2][u] ##I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.   
##If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.   ##Otherwise, you should get an ipod. 
creative[-1][cc]##My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
##features[-][u][cc]It hold's a promised amount of songs, and the headphone jack/volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than creative's.   
##If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive. 
##player[-1][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.      
[t]
##I bought this two months ago at a local retailer, after spending considerable time reading reviews here of this and other 5GB players. 
compatibility with windows media player[+3]  ##While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player. 
format[+2] ##Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.  
accessories[+3] ##I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc). 
Zen Micro[+3] ##And so far, I have been very, very happy with my Zen Micro. 
working[+3][u] ##It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc). 
##Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.   
##I promptly gave the included earbuds to my wife, I'm using a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise-canceling headphones with the Zen Micro. 
features[+3], user interface[+3] ##The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface. 
feel[+3] ##What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel. 
size[+2],feel[+2] ##The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid. 
backlight[+3] ##The blue backlight is pretty cool. 
screen[+2], touchpad[+2] ##The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.  
sound[+3], audio quality[+3] ##- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones. 
##I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.   
##- Integration with Media Player. 
transfer[+2], sync with media player[+1][u] ##The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.  
battery[+1] ##- Replaceable battery. 
##A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.  
##- The FM Radio. 
##I find myself listening to the radio a lot. 
##You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.  
##- Doubles as a removable disk drive. 
interface[+2][u] ##With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.  
player[+3][p] ##I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.  
battery life[-2] ##The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most. 
##Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware. 
##They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon. 
##For me, I get through a typical day's listening just fine, and I could probably squeeze out two days, but it really is no big deal to just charge the Micro overnight. 
battery life[-2] ##Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way. 
warranty price[+2][u], accessories[+2], player[+1][s] ##If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.     
[t]
##Update 8/11/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.  
##I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini. 
price[+2] ##The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less. 
##I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.  
sound[+3] ##Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set. 
look[+3], size[+3][u] ##- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.  
accessories[-2] ##Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod. 
##I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great. 
##I get occasional hiss while driving. 
battery life[-2] ##- The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. 
## Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well. 
firmware[-3] ##I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked. 
outlook sync[-2] ##- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. - ##Several people complained about the touchpad and frankly i'm starting to see why. 
touchpad[-1] ##I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode). 
##I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this. 
audible.com book compatibility[-3][u] ##- Not compatible with Audible.com books.  
Zen Micro[-2] ##Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.     
[t]
##I first signed up for Napster on line.  
##Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go. 
##They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.  
##So my first MP3 player purchase was incorrect.  
##To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.  
##The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.  
##This player is not compatible with Napster To Go. 
##The player was large and bulky.  
##The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.  
##The plus was the storage size but I didn't like hearing the hard drive spin.  
##I also hated the packaging, with a passion.  
##It was one of those plastic glued containers that can take you thirty minutes to open.  
##Accessories were cheap looking.  
##The player was not very appealing either.  
##All this before I found out the bad news.  
##Finally I upgraded the firmware and log in to Napster.  
##Upon logging in I received a notification that my player works with Napster but not Napster To Go. 
##It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.  
##Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off. 
##This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.  
##To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.  
##Its my first purchase choice.  
##Actually only three players are on the list for Napster To Go. 
player[+3][p] ##Don't worry this player rocks.  
appeal[+3] ##It was also the most appealing.   
##Immediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.  
packing[+3][u] ##For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.  
##I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.  
casing[+3] ##It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.  
## You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.  
##Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open. 
case[+3] ##A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.  
##It has Apple insipid written all over it.  
design[+3] ##I do give create to Creative for their attractive design.    
functionality[+2] ##Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices. 
player[+1][p]##Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.  
player[+1][p][cs]##It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.  
quality[+2] ##Everything shines of quality.  
player[+1][cs] ##I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.  
##First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.  
accessories[+2] ##I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.  
##Next I wanted to update the software, after a quick firmware upgrade the player was ready to go. 
##I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created. 
##My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast. 
##So the download was much slower.   
interface[+3] ##The interface works great.  
touchpad[+2] ##I enjoy getting use to the touch pad. 
navigation[+2] ##In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.  
sound[+3] ##What impressed me most was the sound.  
sound[+3] ##At 128 the songs sound very good.  
##My hobby is home audio and home theater.  
audio quality[+2] ##The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.  
headphones[+2] ##The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.  
##Creative says that the software engine for this MP3 is the best hands down.  
##I believe them.  
##Overall this play is my introduction into the market.  
Zen[+1][s]##The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.  
##If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.      
[t]
##I got my Zen Micro last week. 
player[+3][p] ##I absolutely love it. 
size[+3] ##It's so small. 
look[+3]##It looks sleek and modern. 
storage[+3] ##It holds plenty of songs. 
sound[+3] ##The sound is amazing. 
menu[+2] ##The menu is easy to use and understand. 
touchpad controls[+2] ##I love the touchpade controls. 
touchpad controls[+2][p] ##They're easy to use. 
radio[+2], voice recording[+2] ##The radio and voice recording are nice. 
headphones[+2] ##The earbud headphones are really nice. 
batterylife[+2] ##The battery has a long life. 
battery replacement[+2] ##It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course. 
file transfer/rip software[+2] ##The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use. 
file transfer[+2][p][cc] ##It's faster than WMP. 
player[+1] ##So far I have no complaints with this player. 
player[+1][s] ##If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player. 
price[+2], storage[+2], size[+2] ##It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.      
[t]
##If you are like me who wants move to the next phase of portable audio from conventional portable CD players I hope you find this usefull.   
##Space : 5GB =2500 songs. 
##If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection. 
##Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs. 
storage[+2][u]##I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.   
software[+2] ##User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward. 
##Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user). 
PC  software[-2] ##PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all. 
scroll bar[-1] ##The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to. 
storage [+2][u] ##You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).   
Battery[+3] ##Battery : A Big Big plus. 
battery usage[+2][u]##Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery. 
##Zen micro does. 
##I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each). 
##Remember this is a huge plus when travelling. 
battery life[+2][u] ##Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours. 
##If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness. 
battery charging[+2][u] ##Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.  
FM tuner[+2] ##FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing. 
##Dont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.  
FM reception[-2][u] ##Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works. 
microphone[+3] ##Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes. 
##I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.    
sound[+3] ##Sound: This is where I love Zen the most. 
sound[+3] ##Excellent sound I mean the player has juice. 
##I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones. 
##The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones). 
bass[+3], treble[+3] ##The bass treble the sound detail is awsome. 
player[+1][cc] ##I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.  
look[+2] ##Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool. 
size[+2] ##Its compact and has rounded edges. 
size[+1] ##Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.   
belt clip[+1], stand[+1] ##Freebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful. 
belt clip[-1], design[-2] ##I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem). 
##Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine. 
headphones[-3], accessories[+2] ##You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.  
headphones[-2], beltclip design[-2] ##What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design. 
##Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).  
##Stuff you may need to buy: Wired remote from creative. 
##This is a must have. 
##Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging. 
sound[+2] ##FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod. 
##Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking     
[t]
##I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.  
player[+2][u] ##Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.  
Zen micro[+2] ##While I have not had the "privilege", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones.
##Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod". 
##_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.  
player[+2] ##By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.  
Zen micro[+1][s] ##While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.  
##Apple, on the other hand, seems to have engaged in a blind marketing strategy that seeks to obliterate competition through utter abuse of marketing channels and un-orthodox "free player" schemes that just seem to pimp the product without pimping the features.  
##The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.  
look[+2][u], size[+2], battery life[+2] ##About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.  
size[+2], design[+3], ##It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.  
interface[+1] ##The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.  
battery life[+3] ##Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.  
file transfer[+2][u], software[+2] ##Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.  
organizer[+2],software[+2] ##Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.  
design[+2], features[+2] ##All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.  
configuration[-1][u] ##P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.     
[t]
look[+2], player[-2][p] ##This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.  
player[-1][cc] ##The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.  
storage[-1][cc], format[-2][cc] ##The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  
look[+1][cc], interface[-2] ##The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.  
##In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard. 
##The karma also has a very long battery life.  
##Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.  
##No comparison in my opinion.     
[t]
functioning[+1] ##Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright. 
auto load[-2] ##After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player. 
##I tried to figure out another way to load the songs and attempted another upgrade with no results. 
##I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again. 
##I tried the help menu that referenced GUI buttons that don't exist on my version. 
##I'm less than satisfied. 
software[-3] ##It seems like the software is just not responding. 
support[-3] ##The support has been less than impressive, considering the cost. 
##They responded -after I told them I have a Zen Micro and suggested that my "jukebox" needed to be purged. 
support[-3][u] ##I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.     
[t]
##After narrowing my choices down to the Zen Micro or IPod Mini, I read countless reviews on both for about a week until my eyes practically started bleeding. 
##I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings. 
##When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro. 
storage[+2], battery[+2], features[+2][u] ##The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me. 
##Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative. 
working[+2] ##Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.  
##After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened. 
interface[+2], controls[+2] ##I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so. 
##My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'. 
##One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly. 
##A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device. 
manual[+1] ##However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro. 
software[-2] ##While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch. 
loading speed[+2] ##As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song. 
editing titles[+1] ##I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc. 
##after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already. 
sound[+2] ##After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.  
FM reception[-2] ##If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.  
##Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation. 
##I say get one today!!     
[t]
functioning[-3] ##It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general. 
touch pad[-2], access[-2] ##The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.   
make[-3][u] ##Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well. 
player[-3][u] ##It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.   
player[-1][s] ##If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.      
[t]
##After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro. 
##Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world? 
##I have my reasons. 
##I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit. 
price[+1], design[+1] ##Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways. 
player[+2][p] ##Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.  
##I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review. 
size[+2] ##When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY! 
look[+2][u], size[+2][u] ##It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy! 
interface[+1], trim[+1] ##The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus. 
##The iPods, like most Mac products, have a sophisticated but bland, look to them... Preferrably, I like some sass. 
##:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery). 
##In stores, the Micro doesn't even come with the AC adapter.  
sound[+1] ##Moving on to sound department... It delivers! 
##I expected this coming from Creative. 
earbuds[+1], bass[-2] ##The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass. 
earbuds[-1] ##I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC. 
functionality[+2], navigation[+2], touchpad[-1] ##Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it. 
##I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion. 
design[-1] ##Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.  
extra features[+1] ##There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock. 
##I'm guessing the more features you enable, the more the battery will drain. 
battery usage[+1][u] ##Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable! 
##The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback. 
##And if you read the description on Creative's site, it does mention that the "actual battery life will vary with use."
Micro[+2] ##Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*. 
storage[-1][u] ##It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music. 
music transfer[+1] ##Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes. 
features[+2], sound quality[+2] ##It may not top the iPod Mini, but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality.  
design[+2], size[+2][u], comfort[+2][u], look[+2] ##Strong Points: - Design: small, comfortable, curved, and stylish. 
variety of colours[+2] ## 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from. 
sound[+3] ##You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable. 
audio formats[+2] ##- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.  
touch pad[-2], design[-1], volume control[-1] ## Weak Points: - Touch Pad: design could be better - Volume Control: controlled through the vertical strip, but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick. 
FM reception[-2][u] ##- Radio Quality: weak reception     
[t]
look[-3][u], storage[+1] ##It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  
color[-2], touchpad[-2] ##The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad. 
design[-3] ##But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  
audio[+2], player[-3][u] ##What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  
##Creative should hire some real industrial designers.     
[t]
software[-3] ##Still has terrible software.  
software[-3][p] ##You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.  
look[+2], controls[-3], touchpad[-2][u] ##Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.  
storage[+2][u] ##You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.  
screen review[-2] ##Screen review could be better.  
screen review[-1][cc] ##Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.     
[t]
player[+3][p] ##This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price. 
storage[+1], cost[+1] ##the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro. 
features[+2][u] ##It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately. 
design[+3] ##Creative did an awesome job with the design. 
headphones[+2], extra accessories[+2][u] ##The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one. 
player[+2][p] ##I have the black one and adore it. 
look[+2], background light[+3] ##It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black. 
touchpad[-1][u] ## The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal. 
##I take mine everywhere.     
[t]
size[+1], style[+1] ##I bought my Zen Micro three months ago mainly because I preferred the size and style to the iPod mini. 
player[+2] ##Overall, I've been very impressed with the player. 
functioning[+2][u] ##I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date. 
##Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim. 
##Originally I was only getting around 8 hours of playtime out of my Zen Micro, but now I consistently get 10-13. 
firmware[+1] ##I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors. 
battery life[+2][u] ##I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.  
sync to windows media player[+1] ##One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player. 
##With the latest version (10), I can simply browse my WMP library, adding songs/albums/artists to the sync list, and then sync all of the tracks at any time. 
speed[+2][u], look[+2] ##Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking. 
##With WMP10, you don't need to install any software other than the driver, which makes using multiple computers fairly simple.  
touchpad[+2] ##The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example). 
touchpad[+2][p] ##They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons. 
touchpad[+1] ##Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.  
FM reception[-2] ##The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area. 
radio record[+1] ##Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.  
look[+3], feel[+3], sound[+3] ##The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great. 
durability[+2] ##So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own. 
earbuds[+2][p][cc] ##They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers. 
built[+3][u] ##I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.     
[t]
##Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own. 
Zen micro[+2] ##This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.  
##Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems. 
##Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance. 
##To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it? 
##You ask, yup. 
##That's it. 
##I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features. 
##Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
##players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro. 
##My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.  
features[+2][p] ##Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more. 
navigation[+3][u] ##The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense. 
interface[+2] ##The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it. 
transfer speed[+3], battery life[+3] ##Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time. 
features[+2] ##On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again. 
design[+3], ease ofuse[+2] ##So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.  
##Not everything in this world is 1!
Zen[-2] ##00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks. 
file transfer[-2] ##While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer). 
response speed[-1][u] ##Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up. 
##These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such. 
##I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available. 
##Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).  
plaeyr[+1][s] ##That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!

##UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out. 
features[+1][cc], sound quality[+2], music source support[+2] ##Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use. 
##I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work. 
player[+3][p] ##So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all. 
##Then last week, my player just quit working, period. 
warranty[-1]  ##After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty). 
##They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home. 
working[-2] ##Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
##rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.  
##I loved the Zen Micro, and thus it pains me to say this, but I have a hard time recommending something, when I've had two of them break on me in such a short time of owning them. 
quality[-2], reliability[-2] ##They obviously have quality and reliability problems. 
player[-1][s] ##They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  
player[+2][p] ##ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great! 
player[+2][p] ##This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  
sound[+3], rip[+2] ##I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.  
##I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.  
##My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once! 
##Y!
interface[-1] ##es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  
organization[+2][u] ##I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.  
WAV format[-3] ##Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  
##It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try. 
case[-2] ##My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  
belt clip[-1] ##Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.  
bag[-3] ##The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.  
bag[-2] ##It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.  
##I threw it away.  
##Those are minor complaints though.  
player[+1][s] ##I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.  
##Soon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.  
##Amazing.     
[t]
##I'm a new to mp3 players.  
##For years I've downloaded songs and burned CDs, but I decided to simplify my life and get an mp3 player.  
##After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.  
player[-2] ##It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.  
features[+2] ##The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.  
##The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.  
##You can then hook up the Zen via USB to any Win2K or later computer and use that partition to store data files.  
##Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.  
##I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.  
look[+2] ##The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.  
##The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.  
interface[-1] ##On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
software[-2][p] ##is not as intuitive as I would like.  
earbuds[-1] ##Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.  
##I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).  
##You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.  
player[+2][p] ##Overall, I am very pleased with it.  
player[+2][p] ##The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.     
[t]
##I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back. 
##Doing what, you ask? 
##Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.  
##Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out. 
##But, they rushed it to market, so you, general public, get to roll the dice. 
##Are you feeling lucky today? 
##Who knows -- you may avoid a migraine altogether.  
sound quality[+3] ##Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.  
headphones[+1][cc] ##The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds. 
##That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones. 
##I'm getting stunningly good resul!
##ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones. 
##Going further up-market and using super hi-rez audiophile headphones is probably overkill; they will only serve to cast MP3 limitations into sharper relief, and honey, you can't hear what ain't there.  
##An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both. 
##You're better off not dropping below 128 kbps, especially with music. 
##64 kbps is a terrible price to pay. 
##If you absolutely, positively need over 2,000 songs for your next wolverine photo shoot, get a 10 GB player.   
size[+2][u] ##The player is smaller than you think. 
##Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.  
touchpad[-2] ##The touch pad is over-sensitive, and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive. 
##You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.  
##To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
##unboxed and charging up, visit the Creative website for necessary firmware and/or driver upgrades, especially if you're planning to use a service like Napster. ##Keep in mind the required upgrade may be a beta version (mine was).  
##2. Some upgrades are needed for the Micro to work properly with the Windows XP operating system and Media Player 10.  
##3. You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first). 
##My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.  
sound quality[+3], music subscription service[+2] ##Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.     
[t]
##I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon. 
software[-3] ##The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL. 
player[-2] ##After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out. 
##I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything. 
working[-2] ##I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail. 
customer support[-3] ##Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless. 
##Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions? 
##And t!
player[-3] ##his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?  
##I think I'll stick to CDs.     
[t]
Zen micro[+2] ##The Zen Micro is near perfect.   
##I bought my Zen Micro last december as a christmas gift to myself, save for a few software issues, I couldn't be happier with my purhcase.   
##I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips. 
##It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers. 
##3It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered. 
built[+3][u] ##It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   
##I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.   
##All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
##So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player. 
windows compatibility[+2][u] ##The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.   
size[+2][u], sound quality[+3], interface[+2][u], look[+2][u], battery[+1], features[+2] ##It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!
##m. 
##When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.   
##It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip! 
##Most people complain about the sensitivity, but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference.   
##My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy. 
work with WMP[-2] ##It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it. 
##over and over again. 
##But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch. 
##I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.   
accessories[+3] ##The accesories that come with the player are great. 
bag[+1] ##White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag. 
##Also all the required cables and what not. 
##To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
player[+2][p] ##best in class. 
player[+2][p] ##It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.   
quality[+2] ##Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.   
player[+1][s] ##Pick your favorite color and buy it.      
[t]
##Alot of people seem to compare any music player to an Ipod. 
##Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
##About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well. 
touch sensitivity[-2] ##As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front. 
durability[-2] ##Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player. 
durability[-2] ##After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself). 
price[-2] ##Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this. 
##$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players). 
##As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
##e again.  
design[+2], color[+2] ##Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too. 
##They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors. 
features[+2] ##It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).  
battery[+1] ##The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).    
storage[-1][u] ##Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game. 
player[+1][s] ##If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).  
##Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
##he Pencil? 
##Stopping going in circles and get to the point. 
##Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )     
[t]
##so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.  
player[+2][p] ##anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing. 
##I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace. 
##she also got me an iRiver FM modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet, so i can play it through my regular radio.  
##anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware. 
firmware[+2][p] ##the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does. 
look[+2],size[+2], accessories[+2][u] ##+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
##included - charges via USB, so whenever you plug it into your computer, it's charging up. 
battery life[+3], sound quality[+3] ##+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right? 
##Aren't they something of digital sound experts? 
navigation[+2] ##+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for. 
##Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.  
##before i get into the cons, i'll make a note about the scrollpad. 
scrollpad[-1] ##It DOES take some getting used to. 
##my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down. 
##it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it. 
##it's a neutral feature in my book. 
##simple mechanical buttons would probably work !
##just as well and would be less confusing for new owners, but i guess they wanted to rival the iPod's search wheel. 
charging[-1] ##whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side. 
##-doesn't like to be charged via USB on non windows PCs or PCs that don't have the Zen Micro driver installed. 
button functioning[-2][u] ##It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working? 
##Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying. 
##The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC. 
users guide[-1] ##-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website. 
##I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
##(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
##er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
heat[-1][u] ##) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long. 
size[+1][u] ##But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.  
player[+1][p][s] ##Overall though, i'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player, even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the iPod. ;)     
[t]
##I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.  
##Of course the first one I decided to research first was the Apple iPod.  
##However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.  
##In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.    
##So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.  
##I had been eyeing the Creative Zen Micro 5GB as I researched various players.  
Napster 2 go compatibility[+2] ##I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.  
##I have a lot of songs that I need to download.    
##I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
##pick it up from the store.   
##So I decided on the black one.  
player[+2][p] ##And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.  
##It is exactly the same size as my flip phone.  
look[+2] ##It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.   
installation[+1] ##After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.   
##There were two downloads I had to complete.  
##One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.  
##I then registered with Napster 2 Go and it immediately recognized my player.  
##And within one hour I had downloaded , organized my play lists and was listening to the songs I downloaded.  
##Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
sound[+2] ##The sound is very nice.  
##I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.  
##It also comes with a case so you can either stand it up or use a belt clip.  
##So I can't wait to get on my treadmill with it.  
lock feature[+1] ##I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.   
FM reception[-2] ##I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.   
##I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.  
touchpad[-2][p] ##Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.  
##However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.   
player[+2] ##Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.    
##PS.  
##I've been ZETAZEN long before this player came into existence...lol and my player's name is ZETAZEN. 
##:-)  www.zetazen.com

##I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal. 
##They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price. 
##Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like. 
##You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library. 
##Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen. 
Zen micro[+2] ##However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior. 
sound quality[+3] ##I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones. 
FM tuner[+1] ##I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on. 
##When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook. 
scroll bar[-1] ##I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now. 
ease of usage[+2][u] ##Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download. 
size[+2], look[+2] ##Its also smaller, and gets more looks. 
##People are use to seeing so may Ipods, that when they see my Zen, they have to ask questions. 
extra features[+3] ##An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook. 
player[+2][p] ##This is really a no brainer. 
##[+][s] ##BUY THE ZEN!"     
[t]
features[+2] ##I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.  
##After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod. 
touchpad[-3] ##The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want. 
##This is by far my biggest complaint.  
download speed[-3] ##Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.  charging[-2] ##Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.     
[t]
##... then this might intrigue you greatly.  
##The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.  
##Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.  
##The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.  
##At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.  
##Then what?  
##What compels you to choose one over the other?  
##It has to be the UI and user experience.  
##The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.  
##The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.  
##So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.  
##It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.  
##The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.  
##Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.  
Outlook compatibility[+2] ##Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility. 
##This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.  
##I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.  
##However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.  
##What device would I recommend?  
##Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.  
software[+3], tech support[+2], accessories[+2] ##Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  
additional accesories[+1] ##The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  
extra battery[+2] ##The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.  
player[+2] ##If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  
##**** I gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum.  
##I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).  
##Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.  
##Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred     
[t]
##I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.  
##I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.  
player[+2][p], portability[+2][p], size[+2][p] ##This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.  
##My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, "test drive", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.  
plug in[+2] ##I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.  
features[+2], headphones[+2] ##Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore. 
##And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.     
[t]
Napster to go compatibility[-3]  ##If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while. 
firmware[-3] ##A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it. 
##Check out message boards on Napster for more info.     
[t]
##if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro; 
##these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.   
player[+2][p] ##On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.  
sound[+2], storage[+2][u] ##The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.    
look[+3], comfort[+2], weight[+3], interface[+2] ##The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.  
srorage[+2] ##No offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.    
##Now the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro!
##instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.  
radio feature[+1] ##I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.  
FM reception[-2][u] ##Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.  
FM reception[-3][u] ##It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.  
battery life[-2] ##The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.  
##Here's a quote from Creative's web site (hoping to sell additional batteries):   "Carry an extra rechargeable battery for your Zen Micro for an additional 12 hours of nonstop music."  
##Try an additional *six* hours, methinks.  
creative[-2][u] ##Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.    
headphones[+1] ##Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.  
player[+1][u] ##As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.  
##To use a bas!
Zen micro[+2] ##eball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.  
player[-1][u] ##Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.          
[t]
##If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.  
##I looked at the market extensively and took a lot of advice before making the big buy here. 
##I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price. 
##Tall order, eh? 
sound quality[+2][p], battery life[+2][p], capacity[+2][p], look[+2][p], construction[+2][p], price[+2][p], compatibility[+1][p] ##Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.  
sound quality[+3] ##Sound quality? Phenomenal. 
sound quality[+1][cc], earbuds[+2] ##unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.  
##Looks? 
##Let's just say it's no coincidence I put "Foxy Lady" on there. 
variety of colors[+3][u] ##Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.  
##Capacity? 
##Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most. 
storage[+3][u] ##Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums. 
##(Like I really wanted "Hotel California" anyway.
##)  Construction? 
construction[+3][u] ##Tough as nails. 
construction[+3][u] ##No skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two.
##)  Compatibility? 
compatibility[+3] ##Flawless. 
##They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
play WMA[+2] ##) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.  
voice record[+2], player[+1][cc] ##The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player. 
sound[+3] ##Gets nice sound too. 
FM tuner[+1] ##The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.  
##And the price? 
##A bargain $200. 
##Do NOT buy Apple. 
##Inferior quality at a higher price (and shoddy reliability) is not quite justified just because they have a better spokesperson.  
player[+3] ##In conclusion, this player is beautiful. 
ease of use[+2], power[+2] ##Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate. 
player[+2][p] ##But it; you won't regret it.     
[t]
##I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.  
player[+3], functioning[+2][u], touchpad[+2] ##This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.  
sound quality[+3][cc] ##The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.  
radio[+3] ##The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.  
software[+2], file transfer speed[+3][u] ##The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!  
battery[+1], DJ[+2], features[+2] ##I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!  
##Mine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.  
look[+2][u] ##The blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also.  
##Overall I have no complaints, this is jus!
price[+2], player[+3] ##t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?      
[t]
##I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.  
##That was before the Zen Micro came along.  
player[+3][p] ##I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  
look[+3], ease of use[+2], sound quality[+3][cc] ##it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.  
interface[+3], touchpad[+2] ##I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  
##I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.  
Media player compatibility[+3] ##Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?  
##As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.  
##I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it. 
##This appears to prevent the lockup issue.  
##The battery life doesn't appear to be any!
battery life[-1][p] ##where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  
battery life[-1][p] ##I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  
##This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.  
storage[+2] ##The extra Gb is just a bonus.  
headphones[-1] ##The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".  
##Plug in a decent set or hook it up to a stereo system and prepare to be impressed.  
sound[+3] ##If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.     
[t]
##After much research I decided that the Zen Micro was the best mp3 player for me.  
player[-2][u] ##Unfortunately I was wrong.  
player[-3] ##Within one month, my player completely died. 
touchpad[-3][u], buttons[-3] ##(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked. 
working[-3][u] ##So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.  
##Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!  
sound[-3] ##I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.  
##I've tried different headphones, upgrading firmware, using different files and nothing helps.  
customer service[-3] ##I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.  
##I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.  
design[+2] ##It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.  
player[-3][p] ##It's too bad, though, that !
##I don't want to keep testing my luck.  
##This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.     
[t]	       
Zen micro[+2] ##The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers. 
##I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod. 
##Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off. 
battery[+2][u] ##The Zen offered a great alternative. 
##Now, there are many alternatives to the Ipod, but I wanted a nice design, also, and not some generic looking mp3 player. 
##I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod. 
##I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member. 
##What happens follows:       Let's start with the software. 
software[+1] ##It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch. 
##You can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer. 
##The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy. 
sound quality[+2][u] ##The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
##00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software). 
##When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space. 
sound quality[+2] ##Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either. 
##Check the Zen's S/N ratio and DB rating. 
##They're better than the IPOD, plus, there are seven EQ settings (including custom). 
headphones[-3] ##The included headphones suck, so get your own.         
trnasfer[+2] ##Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software. 
format[+2] ##The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod. 
software[+2] ##The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info. 
##and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen. 
organization[+2][u] ##Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen. 
##This feature wo!
labling[+3] ##rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well. 
##Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored. 
##At least, that is, while it's still alive.        
touch screen[-1] ##The touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies. 
##It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first. 
##A trick I used was to manually capitalize all the info. 
##going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes. 
##Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly). 
##The features this thing has are !
FM reception[-2][u] ##just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two. 
touchpad light[+2][u] ##Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer. 
design[-2] ##But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.         
size[+1][cc], storage[+1][u][cc] ##One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs). 
##It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved. 
##I loved this thing. 
##I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing. 
##It cost less than, in most cases, $190. 
battery[+1] ##Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!
##chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.        
design[-3] ##But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything. 
##Why? 
headphone jack design[-3] ##because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack. 
##It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it). 
##There are bulletin boards and customer reviews all over the web talking about it. 
##If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.       
headphone jack[-3] ##Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage. 
##It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use. 
##Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem. 
##I used them. 
headphone design[-3] ##Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
##jack that Creative has acknowledge. 
##I know what you are thinking. 
##You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out. 
##If only only it was that simple. 
Zen[-2] ##The flaw is inside the Zen. 
##You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are. 
headphone jack[-2] ##The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to. 
##In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.           
##There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means? ##Exactly, warranty voided. 
##So, if you don't won't to void your warranty, you will have to get in touch with Creative, they will send you a rma number, fix your Zen, but you lose all of your dogon music. 
Zen micro[-3] ##The Creative Zen Micro is a Zen Micro killer, not an Ipod killer. 
##Do your research; check !
##out the bulletin boards.     
[t]
storage[-1][cc] ##Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???  
##In addition , iPods can be used as portable hard drives and can display your calendars and contact info.      
[t]
audio quality[+3], ease of use[+3], features[+3] ##This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features. 
##However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1. 
usage with subscription service[-2][u] ##To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC. 
##You will also need to download and install new firmware on the player. 
##At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release." 
set up[-1] ##I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.  
##2. 
transfer speed[-2] ##Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly. 
##It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1. 
subscription WMA[-1] ##This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files. 
##The solution? 
##Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring. 
transfer speed[-1][u] ##The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.  
##3. 
##Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit "play," so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts. 
##However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs. 
##The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song. 
subscription DRM-encoded[-1] ##Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.  
##These issues knock a single star off the review. 
player[+1] ##Otherwise, this is a great "alternative" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple. 
player[+2][p] ##I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it. 
##The subscription service lets me download as much as I want, and the player lets me take it wherever I go.

##Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.  
##I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"  
##Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.  
##It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.  
##What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?  
##Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.  
creative[+3] ##I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  
##Of course, some were better than others, and I probably could have gotten a better sound card from another company at some point.  
player[+3][p] ##The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  
interface[+2][cc], storage[+2][cc], battery life[+2][cc] ##It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.  
audio quality[+1][cc] ##Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  
##It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.       
[t]	 
player[+3][p] ##I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned. 
##(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
##) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'. 
##However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.  
##I must say that there are several factors that influenced my purchase. 
##An Apple Ipod Mini was considered. 
features[+3][cc] ##However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.   
storage[+3][u], battery life[+3], extra features[+2][u] ##Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs. 
construction[+3], sound quality[+3], microphone[+2] ##sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!  
user interface[+3] ##As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'. 
##It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'. 
converter[+2] ##This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another. 
formats[+3][u], ##These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted. 
Creative zen Micro[+3][p] ##By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.     
[t]
on[-3], off[-3] ##I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.  
ear phone jack[-3] ##Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.  
player[+1][p] ##When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.   
[t]
LCD[+3]camera quality[+3]##Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
phone[+3][u]##I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
battery life[-2]##The only disappointment so far has been battery life.
battery life[-2][u]##Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
##Why is this phone so great?
##Simple.
phone[+3][p]##It has it all.
phone[+3]##This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
phone[+3]##If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.
[t]
##I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
size[+2]##3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
6600[+3]##6600 looks and feels nice.
bluetooth[+3]##This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
PDA[+3]##I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
s/w[+3]##Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
battery life[+3][u]##Goes ~3 days after a charge.
[t]
##Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.

phone[+3]##I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.
use[+3]##It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
##Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
keypad[+3]##1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
##My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
##I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone.
keypad[+3][cc]##Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
##2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical.
##Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking.
look[+2]##I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
interface[+3]##3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
##There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
MMC card[+3][u]##The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
##I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
Capacity[+3]##Capacity is not a problem here.
Build[+3]##4. The Build is just right.
sturdy[+3][u]##The phone is sturdy.
build[+3][u]##I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
phone[+3][u]##Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
phone[+3][u]##This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
Camera[+3]##5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
bluetooth[+3]##I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
display[+3][u]##The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
colors[+3]##The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
##Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
upgradibility[+3]##It has great upgradibility.
##I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net.
##Now that is neat.
log[+3]##The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.
handsfree[+3]##The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
##I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
processor[-3]ear volume[-2]##Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
battery life[-2]##The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
Video recording[-2]##Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
upgrade[-1][u]##You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
##Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
##When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
##In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.
phone[+3]##This makes for a great phone.
##Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
##gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!

phone[-3]##I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
##Before buying, I'd urge you to actually use one and not just handle it in the store.
phone[-3]##On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
screen[-3][u]##As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
##And remember, this is a PHONE first and foremost which is where I have my biggest complaints...
dial[-3]##When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
keys[-3]##You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
screen[-3][u]##I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
screen[-3]##It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
phone[-3]##I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
##Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
##You'll see what I mean ... if you have a magnifying glass.
[t]
feels[+2],bluetooth[-2]##This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer).
phone[-2][cc]##My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
[t]
##Don't get me wrong.
##I love gadgets, technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way.
##I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
##In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
##Now I'm back to Nokia to try their 6600 model.
[t]
camera[-3]##who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
##What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
##Ha!
[t]
##i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
phone[+3][p]##since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
camera[+3]PDA[+3]##i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
[t]
bulky[-1][u],features[+3][p]##Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
bluetooth[+3]transfer[+3]##I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
##Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
Handsfree[+2]##Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.
Camera[+2],video recording[-1]##Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
slow[-2],bluetooth[-2]##Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
[t]
looking[+2]##This one has a good looking.
look[+2][u]##It's oval and... nice.
shape[+2],keypad[+2],joystick[+2]##I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
use[+3],small[+3][u]##It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big.
screen[+2]##The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
camera[-2]##And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
slow[-2][p]##I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
phone[-2][p]##Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.
##What's wrong with it?
##Is it really slow, or what?
phone[+2][p]##Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.
phone[+2][p]##It's good.
phone[-1][p]##But not good enough for me.
color[+3]##:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.

Nokia[-2][cc]##I have overall been disappointed with Nokia in the past, finding that Samsung and Motorola tended to have better quality phones.
6600[+2][cc]##While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
versatility[+3]features[+3]##What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
##The best features that I use most often are:
audio quality[+3]##1) Great audio quality overall.
audio quality[+3]##Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
##2) Camera phone.
camera[+3]##A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
joystick[+3]##3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
joystick[-2]##The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
ring tone[+3],game[+3]##4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
Nokia[+3]##If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
Bluetooth[+3]##5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
##This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
wide[+2][u]##6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
small[+3][u]##I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
[s]##You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
construction[-2]##My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
construction[+1][u]##I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
[s]##I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
phone[+3]##Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
